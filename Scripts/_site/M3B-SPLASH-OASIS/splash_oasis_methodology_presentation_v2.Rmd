## Genomics today: distorting a signal foundational to biological discovery and medicine?<span style="color:green;">$^1$</span>

- Operating in a paradigm designed for a different era of data and sampling
- Not fully statistical or mathematical<span style="color:green;">$^2$</span>.
- No unification across "microniches" of biology<span style="color:green;">$^3$</span>.
- Reference-dependent<span style="color:green;">$^4$</span>.
- Missing biology
- (Computationally intensive)
- Not AI ready

---

- <span style="color:green;">1</span>: [Dr. Salzman's CGSI 2024 talk](https://youtu.be/nHuc5mlQRQw?t=64).    

- <span style="color:green;">2</span>: An algorithm doesn't have to be statistical or mathematical to work well.  

- <span style="color:green;">3</span>: Do we expect a one-size-fits-all
peri-omic solution common to microniches of biology?

- <span style="color:green;">4</span>: 
The alignment of reads to a
known sequence provides a powerful QC/QA element.  

  - The lack of discussion of data quality and how
quality will impact the results produced by the proposed algotihtm
is a significant omission from the report.  

  - The shallowness of the evaluation does not inform on this critical point.

---

## Why We Need a Reference-Free Approach

- **Reference genomes have fundamental limitations**:
  - Incomplete representation of genetic diversity
  - Missing sequences from understudied populations
  - Poor handling of highly variable regions

- **Alignment-based approaches**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - Struggle with repetitive elements (54% of hg)
  - Cannot detect what's not in the reference
  - Limit discovery of novel biology

- **The SPLASH solution**: Direct *statistical analysis*<span style="color:green;">$^1$</span>
of raw sequence data using anchor-target structure

---

- <span style="color:green;">1</span>: *statistical analysis* here means
computing a number for each target and identifying targets based on these.
 
---

## Why the Anchor-Target Structure Works

- **Biological signal is inherently structured**: 
  - Variation occurs in specific patterns adjacent to conserved regions
  - Most biological variation follows this pattern:
    - Alternative splicing: constant exons with variable junctions
    - Genetic variants: stable regions with point mutations
    - Microbial diversity: conserved genes with variable regions

---

- **Sensitivity through structure**:
  - Anchors provide context for variation
  - Targets capture the biologically meaningful differences
  - Enables detection of patterns without prior knowledge
  - Works across diverse biological domains

- **Unified mathematical framework**:
  - *Contingency tables*<span style="color:green;">$^1$</span>
of anchor-target pairs
  - Same approach applies to viruses, human cells, non-model organisms

---

- <span style="color:green;">1</span>: A contingency table is a way
succinctly summarize sample counts which can be cross-classified by
2 categorical variables.  The contingency table summarization does
not confer any analytical advantage other than providing a natural
and sufficient set of summary statistics  and a way to 
compute chi-squared statistics.

## SPLASH: The Fundamental Concept

![SPLASH Concept Diagram](images/svg/splash_concept_static.png)

---

- **S**tatistically **P**rimary a**L**ignment **A**gnostic **S**equence **H**oming
- Directly analyzes raw sequencing data
- Detects sample-specific sequence variation without alignment
- Unifies detection of multiple forms of sequence variation

---

## SPLASH: How It Works

1. **Extract k-mers (anchors and targets)**
   - Anchor: fixed sequence (k nucleotides long)
   - Target: adjacent sequence (also k nucleotides)

2. **Build contingency tables**
   - Rows: Different targets
   - Columns: Different samples/conditions
   - Cells: Counts of anchor-target pairs

3. **Apply statistical test**
   - Originally used chi-squared test; Now uses OASIS
   - Identifies **statistically significant** sample-specific 
variation<span style="color:green;">$^1$</span>

---

- <span style="color:green;">1</span>: The identification step
is application specific  and should be set empirically; 
significance is just one option for identification,
and is rarely the best way to identify features of interest.



---

## Limitations of Current Statistical Tests

- **Pearson's chi-squared test**^[Not state of the art]
requires expected cell counts ≥5 for valid inference
  - Unreliable for sparse tables 
  - Provides little insight into *which* rows/columns drive differences
  - Computationally inefficient for large tables

- **Log-linear models**:
  - Limited by asymptotic approximations
  - Require iterative procedures that may not converge
  - Poor performance with sparse data

---

## Limitations of Current Statistical Tests (cont'd)

- **Exact tests** (Fisher's, Barnard's, etc.):
  - Computationally prohibitive for large tables
  - Often too conservative for genomic applications
  - Limited interpretability

- **Permutation-based approaches**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - May not provide closed-form p-values
  - Challenging to scale to large datasets

---

## Mathematical Formulation of OASIS

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 1](images/svg/oasis_math_1_problem_setup.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 2](images/svg/oasis_math_2_test_statistic.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 3](images/svg/oasis_math_3_optimization.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 4](images/svg/oasis_math_4_comparison.png)

---

- **Problem setup**: Given contingency table $N = [n_{i,j}]$ with row sums $r_i$ and column sums $c_j$
  - Rows represent targets (sequences)
  - Columns represent samples/conditions
  - Cells contain counts of anchor-target pairs

- **Test statistic**: 
  $$T(N) = \max_{f, c} \frac{f^T (P - P_0) c}{\sqrt{f^T \text{diag}(P_0 c) f}}$$

  Where:
  - $P$ is the column-normalized table: $p_{i,j} = \frac{n_{i,j}}{c_j}$
  - $P_0$ is the independence model: $p^0_{i,j} = \frac{r_i}{n}$
  - $f$ and $c$ are vectors to be optimized

---

- **Interpretation**: Measures deviation from independence model, *optimized for maximum sensitivity*


---

## Optimization-Based Approach to $f$ and $c$

- **Mathematical objective**:
  - Find vectors $f$ and $c$ that maximize the test statistic $T(N)$
  - Must handle high-dimensional, sparse data efficiently
  - Need interpretable results for biological insight

---

- **Optimization method**:
  - OASIS uses singular value decomposition (SVD) of normalized residual matrix
  - $f$ is the left singular vector corresponding to largest singular value
  - $c$ is the right singular vector corresponding to largest singular value

- **Computational advantages**:
  - Closed-form solution via SVD
  - Highly efficient even for large tables
  - *Provable guarantees on statistical power*

---

## OASIS in Practice: Example Computation

Given a contingency table of anchor-target pairs across samples:

1. **Normalize the table** by column sums to get matrix $P$
2. **Compute expected counts** under independence model $P_0$
3. **Apply SVD** to the normalized residual matrix $(P - P_0)$
4. **Extract vectors** $f$ and $c$ from first singular vectors
5. **Compute test statistic** $T(N)$ using optimized $f$ and $c$
6. **Calculate p-value** using closed-form bounds or asymptotic distribution

This approach provides both *statistical rigor* and *biological interpretability*^[
Thes words are not supported by much empirical evidence.]

## For Biologists: Why This Matters

- **Unbiased discovery** + **Unbiased false discovery**
  - Not limited to what's in reference genomes
  - Captures biological variation missed by standard methods

- **Biological interpretation**
  - Protein domain profiling without reference
  - Sample-specific sequence variation relates directly to biological function

---

- **Applied examples**:
  - Detection of RNA splicing variations 
  - Identification of pathogen strain differences
  - Analysis of immune receptor diversity

---

## For Bioinformaticians: Technical Benefits 

- **Computational efficiency**
  - Avoids computationally expensive alignment
  - Scales to large datasets

- **Statistical Benefits**<span style="color:green;">$^1$</span>:
  - OASIS provides finite-sample valid statistics
  - Closed-form P-value calculations avoid permutation testing
  - Controls for multiple testing

--- 

-  <span style="color:green;">1</span>:  I'm not sure I beleve this
and it doesn't matter.
All we need is that the statistics provide a useful index which
can be used to identify interesting targets.

## Conclusion: A New Paradigm which may or may not...

- **Unified approach** to genomic analysis
- **Reference-free discovery** enables novel findings
- **Statistical rigor** through OASIS methodology
- **Computationally efficient** analysis at scale
- **Biologically interpretable** results
- **Future directions**: Expanding to additional omics technologies

---

## More Rigorous Assessments are Needed

<p><p/>
- **Current evaluation approaches are insufficient for omics-scale methods**:
  - Limited benchmarks that don't reflect real-world complexity
   - Need a battery of objective benchmarks
which reflect meaningful endpoints
 
---


- **A holistic assessment framework should include**:
  - Datasets reflecting end-to-end process variability
  - Samples from varied sources and conditions
  - Battery of meaningful metrics measuring field performance
  - Comprehensive comparison with all competing methods

---

## Variability - Variability - Variability

- The full range of data quality which may be present
in successful RNASeq data sets must be accounted for.


- The presence of unwanted variability must also be
accounted for in the design and evaluation steps.

- See Molania et. al (2023) for indication of
the extent and impact of unwanted variability in RNA-Seq data,
and ways to remove it.

<!--
- I expect unwanted variability to be a more formidable threat
to validity in a reference-free context as the mapping of sequences 
to a reference already filter a lot of the bad stuff.
-->

## TO DO

- Everything that this study glossed over -
variability regimes which come with the omic territory
