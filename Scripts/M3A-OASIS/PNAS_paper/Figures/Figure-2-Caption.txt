Figure showing the algorithms we build using OASIS. (A) OASIS-opt employs data-splitting to generate optimized, data-dependent $f$ and $c$, before generating a statistically valid P-value bound using the held-out test data. (B and C) depict two algorithms we propose for inferring latent structure from a collection of tables defined on the same set of columns. As building blocks, we use OASIS-opt for embedding-aggregation, and OASIS-iter (Section 5.1) for counts-aggregation. (B) Embedding-aggregation (Algorithm 2) performs inference on each table marginally using OASIS-opt and aggregates the resulting sample embeddings. (C) Counts-aggregation (Algorithm 1) stacks the contingency tables into one large matrix 
, and performs iterative analysis on this aggregated table using OASIS-iter.
