# Professional Development Plan for Experienced Statisticians - Change Log

## Document Development History

### Version 1.0 - Initial Creation
- Created comprehensive professional development plan structure
- Established three main learning tracks:
  1. Modern Statistical Methods and Approaches
  2. Modern Reporting and Communication  
  3. Reproducibility of Statistical Analysis
- Added Appendix with Computing Environment Modernization
- Included Implementation Plan, Assessment Strategy, Resource Requirements, and Extension Activities

### Version 2.0 - Content Reorganization
- Moved Implementation Plan, Assessment Strategy, Resource Requirements, and Extension Activities to Appendix as subsections 5.2-5.5
- Changed terminology from "Learning Tracks" to "Sections" throughout
- Removed "Section X:" prefix from section titles for cleaner formatting

### Version 3.0 - Section Reordering
- Reordered sections to place "Modern Reporting and Communication" before the Appendix
- Updated section numbering throughout document to reflect new structure

### Version 4.0 - AI/LLM Integration Updates
- Rewrote AI/LLM Integration introduction focusing on impact on data summarization
- Updated objective to: "Gain an understanding of the strengths and limitations of AI assistants and large language models"
- Added Yu and Kumbier's PQRS framework (Population, Question, Representativeness, Scrutiny)
- Added note that PQRS framework applies to both AI and machine learning contexts
- Added third paragraph on practical applications for experienced statisticians

### Version 5.0 - Machine Learning and Bayesian Updates
- Created comparison table for Machine Learning vs. Traditional Statistical Methods
- Added "Examples" row to comparison table (linear regression, ANOVA vs. random forests, neural networks)
- Clarified meaning of "integrate machine learning with traditional statistical approaches"
- Reordered sections: Bayesian Methods moved after Machine Learning
- Updated Bayesian introduction: changed "accessible" to "prevalent"
- Added Frequentist vs. Bayesian comparison table
- Replaced "Parameters" with "Estimand" in comparison table
- Updated Small Sample Performance description to clarify that Bayesian precision comes from assumptions
- Added David Freedman's critical perspective on both Bayesian and frequentist approaches

### Version 6.0 - Causal Inference Enhancement
- Expanded introduction to Causal Inference section
- Added references to David A. Freedman (2009) and Erich L. Lehmann's reservations about causal claims
- Modified objectives and activities to include critical evaluation of causal inference limitations

### Version 7.0 - Reproducibility Section Overhaul
- Added comprehensive introduction to Section 3 on Reproducibility
- Defined and distinguished reproducibility, replicability, and repeatability
- Added references to replication crisis (Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Begley & Ellis, 2012; Camerer et al., 2016)
- Included RNA-Seq example with Molania et al. (2023) reference
- Corrected author from "Bin Lu" to "Bin Yu" throughout document
- Rewrote section 3.2 as "Bin Yu's Veridical Data Science Framework"
- Added primary reference: Yu & Kumbier (2020) PNAS paper
- Updated activities to focus on PCS (Perturbation, Computation, Stability) framework

### Version 8.0 - Introduction Enhancements
- Added introductory paragraphs to all subsections
- Enhanced each introduction to provide context and rationale
- Improved transitions between sections

### Version 9.0 - CSS and Formatting
- Created initial CSS file for document styling
- Fixed line width issues (increased max-width to 1000px)
- Resolved enumerated list formatting problems
- Added table styling CSS for proper borders and grid lines
- Created responsive design elements

### Version 10.0 - Final Refinements
- Fixed duplication of sections 4.1-4.3 after Appendix heading
- Added comprehensive References section at end of document
- Created this change log
- Ensured all cross-references and section numbers are correct

## Key Contributors to Document Evolution
- Initial requirements specified experienced statisticians (10-15+ years)
- Emphasis on practical applications over theoretical knowledge
- Focus on integration of new methods with existing expertise
- Corrections from subject matter experts (e.g., Yu vs. Lu, PQRS framework application)

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Document format: Markdown
- Styling: Custom CSS
- Conversion tool: Pandoc
- Command: `pandoc -s stats-pd-plan-final.md -c stats-pd-plan-css-tables.css -o professional-development-plan.html`

## Future Considerations
- Document designed to be modular for customization
- Can be adapted for different experience levels
- Framework allows for addition of new technologies and methods
- References section enables ongoing updates with new literature
