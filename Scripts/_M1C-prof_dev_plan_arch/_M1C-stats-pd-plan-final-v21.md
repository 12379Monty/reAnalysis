## 1. Introduction and Methodology

This professional development plan is designed for statisticians with 10-15+ years of experience who need to update their skills with the latest developments in statistical computing, analysis, and reporting methods.

### How This Plan Was Developed

This plan was created by analyzing several key factors:

1. **Identifying the knowledge gap** between traditional statistical methods (what statisticians with 10-15+ years of experience likely learned initially) and modern approaches that have gained prominence in recent years

2. **Incorporating current trends** in the field of statistics, such as:
   - Reproducible research practices
   - Cloud computing and scalable analysis
   - Bayesian methods becoming more prevalent
   - The integration of ML techniques with classical statistical approaches
   - The emergence of AI tools like GPT models for augmenting statistical workflows

3. **Applying effective learning structures** for experienced professionals:
   - Hands-on activities rather than lectures
   - Comparative exercises that build on existing knowledge
   - Peer-based learning opportunities
   - Project-based approaches for complex topics

4. **Balancing technical and communication skills**, recognizing that modern statistical practice requires both methodological expertise and the ability to effectively communicate insights

The curriculum is organized into sections that progress logically: first focusing on modern methodological approaches and communication strategies, with technical computing environment updates available in the appendix for those who need them.

## 2. Modern Statistical Methods and Approaches

### 2.1. AI and LLM Integration for Statistical Work

Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models are impacting the way data are summarized and reported in all industries which depend on accurate data summarization. In applied statistics, tasks whose solution can be described by an algorithm or which entail summarizing published findings - code generation, debugging, literature review, and explanation - have already been impacted by the advent of AI. Tasks which require innovation and creativity will not benefit from the current round of AI tools. Even when they are useful, it cannot be over-emphasized that AI generated results must always be verified by field experts. Experienced statisticians can benefit by incorporating useful AI tools into their workflow. They may also help in the development of next generation AI tools for statistical data analysis.

* **Format:** Workshop with hands-on exercises (4 hours)
* **Objective:** Gain an understanding of the strengths and limitations of AI assistants and large language models in assisting statistical analyses
* **Activities:**
  * Evaluate capabilities and limitations: Compare AI-assisted statistical analysis with traditional approaches across different tasks
  * Develop effective prompting strategies specific to statistical questions and code development
  * Practice critical evaluation of AI-generated statistical code and explanations for errors and misunderstandings
  * Explore ethical considerations in AI-assisted statistical practice, including citation, transparency, and potential biases
  * Design hybrid workflows that combine AI assistance with human statistical expertise and domain knowledge
  * Create guidelines for responsible use of AI tools in your statistical team or organization

### 2.2. Machine Learning Integration

| Aspect | Traditional Statistical Methods | Machine Learning Approaches |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Desired Inference/Statistic** | Focus on inference, hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation | Focus on prediction accuracy and pattern recognition |
| **Model Interpretability** | Emphasize model interpretability and understanding underlying data structures | Often sacrifice interpretability for performance |
| **Model Derivation** | Require explicit model specification based on domain knowledge | Can automatically discover complex relationships without explicit programming |
| **Inference Space/Data Generation** | Primarily concerned with uncertainty quantification and statistical significance; Often rely on assumptions about data distributions (e.g., normality) | Primarily concerned with generalization to new data; Generally more flexible with fewer distributional assumptions; Require larger datasets to perform effectively |
The most effective modern statistical practice often involves thoughtfully combining elements of both traditional statistical methods and machine learning approaches, using statistical rigor to guide and interpret machine learning applications.

* **Format:** Project-based learning (6 hours split across multiple sessions)
* **Objective:** Effectively integrate machine learning with traditional statistical approaches
* **Activities:**
  * Identify appropriate use cases for ML vs. traditional statistical methods
  * Develop a taxonomy of problems and corresponding methodological approaches
  * Implement hybrid models that combine statistical rigor with ML flexibility
  * Critical evaluation exercise: Analyze published papers that use ML methods for statistical inference

### 2.3. Bayesian Methods in Practice

| Aspect | Frequentist Approach | Bayesian Approach |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Philosophical Foundation** | Probability as long-run frequency | Probability as degree of belief |
| **Estimand** | Functional of the data-generating distributionâ€”a fixed but unknown quantity derived from the distribution of the data (e.g., the mean, variance, or a regression coefficient) | Same functional of the data-generating distribution, but inference target is the posterior distribution of that functional given the observed data |
| **Prior Knowledge** | Not formally incorporated | Explicitly modeled through prior distributions |
| **Inference Results** | Point estimates, confidence intervals, p-values | Posterior distributions, credible intervals |
| **Interpretation** | Confidence interval: "95% of similarly constructed intervals contain the true parameter" | Credible interval: "95% probability the parameter lies in this range" |
| **Small Sample Performance** | Relies solely on observed data; wider intervals reflect greater uncertainty with small samples | Can appear to perform better with small samples, but precision gains come entirely from prior assumptions, effectively supplementing observed data with assumed information |
| **Complexity Handling** | Can struggle with highly complex hierarchical models | Naturally handles hierarchical structures and complex dependencies |
| **Computation** | Often has closed-form solutions | Typically requires MCMC or other sampling methods |
| **Examples** | Hypothesis testing, MLE, linear regression | Hierarchical models, probabilistic programming |

Bayesian statistical methods have seen a significant rise in prevalence due to increased computational capabilities and growing acceptance in various fields. This approach, once primarily confined to specialized applications, has become increasingly common across disciplines. For experienced statisticians primarily trained in frequentist approaches, Bayesian methods provide powerful new tools for addressing complex problems and communicating uncertainty.

It's worth noting that some prominent statisticians have expressed fundamental concerns about Bayesian approaches. David A. Freedman, who began as a Bayesian but later became critical of both Bayesian and complex frequentist models, argued that Bayesian models provided interesting mathematical problems but were not necessarily more helpful in extracting useful information from data (Freedman, 1995, "Some issues in the foundation of statistics"). Freedman maintained that in many applications, both Bayesian and frequentist models risked drawing conclusions driven more by assumptions than by data when those models were not adequately supported by empirical evidence (Freedman, 2009, "Statistical Models and Causal Inference: A Dialogue with the Social Sciences"). This perspective highlights the importance of critically evaluating all statistical approaches and understanding their foundational assumptions.

* **Format:** Case-study workshop (4 hours)
* **Objective:** Apply Bayesian approaches to real-world statistical problems while critically evaluating their strengths and limitations
* **Activities:**
  * Compare frequentist vs. Bayesian approaches to the same problem
  * Implement Bayesian models using modern tools (Stan, PyMC3, brms)
  * Develop intuition for prior selection through interactive simulations
  * Critically evaluate the impact of prior assumptions on posterior inference
  * Group challenge: Design and implement a Bayesian solution to an industry-relevant problem

### 2.4. Causal Inference Methods

Causal inference methods attempt to move beyond correlation to establish causal relationships in observational data. While these approaches have become increasingly sophisticated and widely used, they remain controversial among some statisticians who question the validity of causal claims from non-randomized studies. Statisticians like David A. Freedman (2009, "Statistical Models and Causal Inference") and Erich L. Lehmann have expressed fundamental reservations about the credibility of conclusions drawn from such analyses, arguing that observational data often fails to meet the strong assumptions required for valid causal inference and that statistical adjustments cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding.

* **Format:** Seminar with practical exercises (4 hours)
* **Objective:** Master modern causal inference frameworks and methods while understanding their limitations
* **Activities:**
  * Compare traditional regression approaches with modern causal inference methods
