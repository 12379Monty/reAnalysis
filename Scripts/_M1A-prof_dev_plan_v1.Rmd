# Prologue 

In the present we outline a professional development plan 
designed for statisticians with 10-15+ years of experience 
who need to update their skills with the latest development.

* What changes were necessary, and why
   - new dataset sizes and data types prompt new ststistical
computing environments to be developed.

# Introduction

This professional development plan is designed for statisticians with 10-15+ 
years of experience who need to update their skills with the latest developments
in:  

* statistical computing  
* analysis   
* reporting methods    

The professional development program 
was created with assistance from Claude, an AI assistant developed by Anthropic.
Claude helped structure the training modules, generate activity descriptions,
and organize the implementation timeline based on current trends in statistical
computing and modern methodologies. The AI incorporated feedback and
made targeted revisions to sections about machine learning methodologies
and computing environments, demonstrating how AI tools can be used
collaboratively for curriculum development.

- Pair programming: Team up experienced statisticians with those already familiar with modern tools
- Migration exercise: Convert an existing analysis script from legacy software to modern alternatives

## Version Control and Reproducible Analysis
**Format**: Interactive tutorial with practice (2 hours)

**Objective**: Master Git/GitHub for code versioning and collaboration

**Activities**: 

- Set up personal GitHub repositories for statistical projects
- Practice creating branches, commits, and pull requests
- Implement a reproducible analysis workflow using Git, R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks
- Review each other's repositories and provide feedback on structure and documentation

## Cloud Computing for Statistical Analysis
**Format**: Guided exploration (2 hours)   

**Objective**: Utilize cloud platforms for scalable statistical analysis

**Activities**:  

- Set up environments on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- Deploy and run statistical models on cloud infrastructure
- Compare performance between local and cloud-based computation for large datasets
- Collaborative challenge: Develop a cloud-based analysis pipeline for a complex dataset

<br/>

# Learning Track 2: Modern Statistical Methods and Approaches
