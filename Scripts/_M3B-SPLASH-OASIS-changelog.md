## Development Notes

### Methodological Approach
This project takes a **critical but constructive** approach to evaluating the SPLASH-OASIS methodology:

1. **Acknowledges innovation**: Recognizes the novel statistical approach and biological applications
2. **Identifies evaluation gaps**: Points out the inadequate χ² comparator and missing benchmarking
3. **Provides solutions**: Offers comprehensive framework for proper evaluation
4. **Maintains scientific rigor**: Emphasizes objective benchmarking and validation

### Technical Implementation
- **Modular design**: Separate components for presentation, analysis, and evaluation
- **Reproducible research**: All code and methods documented
- **Platform agnostic**: Works with multiple rendering systems (Pandoc, R Markdown, Jupyter)
- **Extensible framework**: Easy to add new methods and benchmarks

### Quality Assurance
- **Peer review ready**: Professional presentation format
- **Scientifically rigorous**: Based on established RNA-seq best practices
- **Practically applicable**: Real R code that can be executed
- **Educationally valuable**: Teaches proper benchmarking standards
