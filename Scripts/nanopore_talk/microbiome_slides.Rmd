## Introduction and Context for this Work

- **Aim:** Achieving strain-level amplicon-based bacterial microbiome profiling with nanopore-quality reads.

- What species (and, ideally, strains of species) are present and in what relative abundance?

- Nanopore sequencing - noisy, long reads.

- Denoising to give Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).

- Look for matches against an appropriate database.

- Can then determine what organisms are present and, relatively, how much of each.

- Have developed a method for analysing matches to profile bacterial microbiota.

- Paucity of high quality nanopore-sequenced amplicon data publicly available.

- Good simulated data has allowed markedly more complete evaluation of the profiling method.

## Problems and a Solution

- Publicly available 16S and 23S rDNA genes that were ONT nanopore-sequenced with state-of-the-art R10.4.1 pores were not available.

- Extracted such sequences from published
  - WGS data for an 8 bacterial species whole genome sequencing study.
  - Partial 16S-ITS-23S ribosomal DNA sequences from preferred primer pairs for extraction

- Demonstrated strain-level resolution over 2 orders of relative abundance based on this data.

- Limitations in generality as the mock microbiomes of these studies had all bacteria differing at the genus level.

- Simulation seen as only current approach to more demanding assessment of method.

- Badread simulator of Ryan Wick seemed to be the most suitable simulator

- Also considered squiggle-based simulators (Beslic et al. 2025, Gamaarachi et al. 2024) and Nanosim.

## Key Data Requirements

- Reference library of rDNA sequences of bacteria relevant to the microbiomes of interest.

- Libraries of 16S, 23S and rDNA operons representative of nanopore-sequenced microbiomes

- A procedure to process such libraries to identify at strain, or near-strain, resolution what organisms are present and their relative abundances.

- For each strain or species of the database have all operons of that strain identified in the database.

## The Human Gut Microbiome

- WEHI is a medical research institution.

- Human gut microbiome is being perceived as of increasing relevance to physical and mental health.

- Rapid development in knowledge of composition of healthy and disease state microbiomes.

- King et al (2019) proposed a set of bacteria and their relative abundances as an attempt to move to some standardisation of a healthy human gut.

- I took this as a basis for my current work.

- This "standard" gut microbiome has 160 different strains of bacteria and their relative abundances - not all identified at the strain level.

- Used a subset of strains and rank ordering of abundances to specify a mock microbiome all at the strain level.

## Results

---

## Real Reads Source 1 - Sereika et al.

- Have 16S and 23S data, no rrn data.

- Used an upper bound on read mean error rate of 0.01 errors/base

- For 16S have 23136 fastq record, reduced to 6430 after quality and length filtering.

- For 23S have 23613 fastq record, reduced to 5334 after quality and length filtering.

## Summary Sereika results

- **Data quality:** Very good - some reads with error rates <0.005

- **Identification:** Very good - 16S species-level has 1 invalid species (Bacillus intestinalis). Due to ties in g score (100%)

- **Quantification:** Moderate - noisy, but positive correlation of observed with design.

## Real Reads Source 2 - Srinivas et al.

- Two mock microbiomes from this study were considered
  - ATCC "even"; 10 bacterial strains, all of different genus; provided as equal masses of genomic DNA for each strain.
  - Zymobiomics D6311; 7 bacterial strains, all of different genus; provided as masses forming geometric series, with ratio 1:10 - called a "logarithmic" microbiome.

- For each microbiome 1 of 4 pairs of start and end primers to define the 16S-ITS-23S amplicons was used.

- Identify datasets as SA1, SA2, SA3 and SA4 for the ATCC source, and as SZ1, SZ2,.. for the Zymobiomics source.

## Read Quality for Denoising - Notes

- Figures 6 and 7 show very few reads with error rate below 0.008. The reads of these datasets are markedly inferior to those from Sereika et al.

- Some entries have bracketed numbers indicating the total number of unique genera or species that were labelled, with the preceding unbracketed number being the number of valid labellings.

- ASVs were cut (removed) because their alignment was too short or the alignment score fell below a specified threshold.

- Comparison with Sereika datasets shows the importance of data quality extending below a mean read error rate of about 0.008 errors per base.

## Identification Notes

- Table 1 shows that there is more success with the ATCC even microbiome than the Zymo logarithmic microbiome

- The data is unable to support identification of any component in the Zymo microbiome other than the 2 most abundant - despite the taxonomic level of differentiation being genus.

- The following figures provided visualisation for SA1, SZ1 and SA2. SA2 was chosen as it is perhaps the best-performing of the Srinivas datasets on identification.

- In all figures most read clusters have no ASV associated with them. Hence our quantification method will be wildly inaccurate as most reads are not counted.

Figure 11: Observed species and genus relative abundance vs. designed microbiome as determined from the 16S-ITS-23S sequences extracted using primer pair 2 for the ATCC mock microbiome.

## Quantification Notes

- The plots include both strains that are in the design but not observed (classified as "missed", and lying along the zero line for observed value), and those observed strains that are not actually in the design (classified as "invalid", and lying along the zero line for design value).

- The correlation between observed and design relative abundances is computed based only on those points representing observed strains that do exist in the designed microbiome.

- As expected, quantification was close to meaningless.

- Note that there can be more than one ASV for a single operon - for instance two perfect alignments but of different length.

## Simulated Reads Source - King + Wick

- From King et al.'s 160 strains, identified 59 that could be matched at strain level in the Walsh et al.'s Refseq-derived rrn operon database.

- Using the average relative abundance (RA) values of King the strains were rank-ordered and given relative abundances reported by King then scaled to sum to 1. Final values ranged from approximately 0.5 to 0.0001.

- The set of 59 strains have a total of 288 operons. For each operon a sufficiently large number of reads were simulated to allow construction of a mock microbiome with approximately 50000 or 25000 reads per operon for the most abundant strain (*Phocaeicola vulgatus* ATCC 8482).

- Two qualities of this mock microbiome, labelled C01 and C11, were generated using Wick's badread code. Also, 3 types of sequences were used - 16S, 23S rRNA genes of 16S-ITS-23S (rrn) operons.

## Quality - Notes

- There is a clear improvement from C01 to C11 in the distribution of read error rate.

- The C11 distribution of reads is closer than the Sereika data, but lacks the reads below an error rate of about 0.0075.

- C11 is clearly better than the Srinivas datasets, while C01, while also better, is more similar.

- Overall, the simulated data quality falls between the data quality of the two real reads sources.

- mKB_rrn_C01 has 12746 reads input to RAD denoising, and 197 ASVs formed.

- mKB_rrn_C11 has 98762 reads input to RAD denoising, and 523 ASVs formed.

## Multi-strain Species Visualisations

- This microbiome has multiple species that have more than one strain present.

- ASVs and their associated reads were selected for each of 4 species - *Bifidobacterium longum*, *Bifidobacterium breve*, *Escherichia coli* and *Bacteroides fragilis*.

- Each of these, separately, had a 2D UMAP generated and they are presented next.

- These visualisations are key evidence for the strain-level resolution that can be obtained.

## Identification - Summary

- There are 4 *Bifidobacterium longum* strains observed 3 of which are in the design. Two less specific database entries (subspecies *longum* and *infantis*) are also listed, and an invalid strain identification *infantis* 157F given.

- There are 2 *Bifidobacterium bifidum* strains observed, both of which are in the design. No invalid strains are listed.

- The *Bacillus fragilis* plot has 2 strains observed, both of which are in the design. No invalid strains are listed.

- For *Escherichia coli* the plot shows 9 strains, but 2 of those are not in the designed mock microbiome. One strain that was in the design was not identified.

- Relative abundances of the strains correctly identified in these multi-strain species range from 0.070 to 0.0017 or rank order 5 through to 33, while missed strains have RA ranks of 30, 37, 40 and 51.

Figure 19: Relation between the observed genera's relative abundance and that of the designed microbiome as determined from badread-simulated full rrn sequences.

## Quantification - summary

- Observed abundances range over approximately 3 orders of magnitude.

- Observed abundances are strongly correlated with the design abundances.

## Outcomes

- These results show that, with appropriate processing of good quality read libraries from current ONT nanopore sequencing technology, strain-level taxonomic resolution of bacterial microbiomes is feasible.

- Furthermore, such resolution is achieved for strains of species that constitute less than 1% of the microbial cellular content - implying that the individual strains themselves are a smaller component of the microbiome.

- The analysis has already demonstrated the value of good simulation and its appropriate use. This is without the multitude of additional analyses that could usefully be implemented via simulation.

## Limitations

- The real data lacked taxonomic depth and consisted of a small number of bacteria in the mock microbiomes.

- The databases used, despite being recently published, are quite small by comparison with databases for analyses limited to higher taxonomic level such as species level.

- Ribosomal RNA features by themselves are not adequate for accurate identification of very close strain. This is particularly pertinent when it comes to medical uses of engineered strains, or the use of probiotics - especially if they are to be used for medical treatment purposes (e.g. gut dysbiosis in infants).

## Final Comment

## Extras - Bland-Altman Plots

* To look at the agreement between designed and observed proportions
we can use the Bland-Altman plots (aka mva)
   - produces more meaningful assessments of accuracy, IMO.

* Some problems with the plots and summaries:
  - design values are fixed and given without error:
Bland-Altman analyses are for random X and Y
  - the correlation coefficient cannot be interpreted in the usual
way for the same reasons

  - the MA (B-A) scatters do not agree with the x vs y scatters.
  - using a global mean to summarize a scatter marked with trends 
is not useful.

* These statistics have no inferential value and should 
probably not be quoted.
