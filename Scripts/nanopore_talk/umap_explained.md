# UMAP Projections for Microbiome Sequence Analysis

## High-Level Description of UMAP

### What is UMAP?

**UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D) while preserving the overall structure and relationships in the data.

**Key Concept:**
Think of UMAP as creating a map from complex, multi-dimensional data. Just as a 2D map of Earth preserves neighborhoods and relative distances (though not perfectly), UMAP creates a 2D representation of high-dimensional sequence data that keeps similar sequences close together and dissimilar sequences far apart.

### Mathematical Foundation (Simplified)

**Basic Principles:**

1. **Manifold Assumption**: Assumes data lies on or near a lower-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional space
2. **Topological Data Analysis**: Uses concepts from topology to understand data structure
3. **Local + Global Structure**: Preserves both local neighborhoods and broader global relationships

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Construct high-dimensional graph**:
   - For each point, find its k-nearest neighbors
   - Measure distances in the original high-dimensional space
   - Create a weighted graph connecting similar points

2. **Optimize low-dimensional representation**:
   - Initialize points randomly in 2D/3D space
   - Iteratively move points to match the high-dimensional structure
   - Minimize the difference between high-D and low-D graphs

3. **Fuzzy topology**:
   - Uses probabilistic "fuzzy sets" rather than hard boundaries
   - Allows for more nuanced representation of relationships

### Key Parameters

**n_neighbors** (default: 15)
- Controls how UMAP balances local vs. global structure
- Small values (5-10): Emphasize local structure, fine detail
- Large values (50-100): Emphasize global structure, broader patterns
- For microbiome: 15-30 works well for strain-level clusters

**min_dist** (default: 0.1)
- Minimum distance between points in low-dimensional space
- Small values (0.001-0.01): Tight, densely packed clusters
- Large values (0.5-1.0): More spread out, focus on broad structure
- For microbiome: 0.01-0.1 to see distinct strain clusters

**metric** (default: 'euclidean')
- Distance measure in high-dimensional space
- Options: euclidean, manhattan, cosine, hamming, jaccard
- For sequences: hamming (for aligned sequences) or custom k-mer distances

## How UMAP is Used in Microbiome Sequence Analysis

### Application to 16S/23S rRNA Sequences

In your presentation, UMAP is used to visualize and cluster similar ribosomal RNA sequences from nanopore sequencing data. Here's how:

### Step 1: High-Dimensional Representation

**Sequence Data as High-Dimensional Vectors:**

Each DNA sequence read is represented in a high-dimensional space using one of several methods:

**A. k-mer Frequency Vectors**
- Break sequences into overlapping k-mers (e.g., k=5: "ACGT" → "ACGTG", "CGTGA", etc.)
- Count frequency of each k-mer
- Creates a vector of dimension 4^k (e.g., 1024 dimensions for k=5)

Example:
```
Sequence: ACGTACGT
k=3 kmers: ACG, CGT, GTA, TAC, ACG, CGT
Vector: [ACG:2, CGT:2, GTA:1, TAC:1, ...]
```

**B. Alignment-Based Distance Matrix**
- Align all sequences to each other (or to reference)
- Calculate pairwise distances (edit distance, % identity)
- Create distance matrix (N×N for N sequences)

**C. Embedding from Neural Networks**
- Pass sequences through learned embeddings
- Each sequence becomes a dense vector (e.g., 512 dimensions)

### Step 2: UMAP Projection

**Input**: N sequences, each represented as a high-dimensional vector (e.g., 1024-d k-mer vector)

**Output**: N points in 2D space (x, y coordinates)

**Process:**
```
High-D space (1024 dimensions)  →  UMAP  →  2D space (x, y)
Each sequence is a point              Each sequence is a point
Similar sequences are "close"         Similar sequences are "close"
```

### Step 3: Visualization and Interpretation

**What You See in Your Figures:**

Looking at your Figures 2, 3, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 (the 2D UMAP plots):

**Clusters = Similar Sequences**
- Each point represents one sequence read or ASV
- Points close together = similar sequences
- Distinct clusters = different taxa (species/strains)

**Colors/Symbols = Taxonomic Labels**
- Different colors/symbols show different identified species
- Allows validation: do sequences from the same species cluster together?

**Read Clouds Around ASVs**
- ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) are shown as labeled points
- Surrounding cloud of points = individual noisy reads
- Tight clouds = high-quality data with low error
- Diffuse clouds = noisier data

### Specific Use Cases in Your Analysis

**1. Quality Assessment**
- Well-separated clusters → good taxonomic resolution
- Overlapping clusters → sequences too similar or high error rates
- Outlier points → potential contaminants or errors

**2. ASV Validation**
- ASV should be in the center of its read cluster
- Reads should cluster tightly around their ASV
- Multiple ASVs in one cloud → potential over-splitting

**3. Taxonomic Structure**
- Clear separation between species (Figures 10, 11)
- Sub-clusters within species = strains (Figures 15, 16)
- Validates strain-level resolution capability

**4. Data Quality Comparison**
- Sereika data (Figures 2, 3): Tight, well-separated clusters
- Srinivas data (Figures 8, 9, 10): More diffuse, reflecting lower quality
- Simulated data (Figures 13, 14): Very clean, as expected

## Advantages of UMAP for Sequence Analysis

### Why UMAP Works Well for Microbiome Data

**1. Preserves Hierarchical Structure**
- Maintains both species-level and strain-level relationships
- Allows visualization of taxonomic hierarchy in 2D

**2. Handles High Dimensionality**
- Sequences have thousands of features (k-mers, positions)
- UMAP effectively reduces to 2D without losing key relationships

**3. Scalable**
- Can handle tens of thousands of sequences
- Faster than many alternatives (e.g., t-SNE)

**4. Deterministic (with fixed seed)**
- Reproducible results
- Important for scientific analysis

**5. Tunable**
- Parameters allow focus on local (strain) or global (genus/family) structure
- Can be optimized for specific applications

**6. Intuitive Interpretation**
- Distances in 2D roughly correspond to sequence similarity
- Clusters are visually obvious

## Alternative Dimensionality Reduction Methods

### 1. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

**Description:**
- Earlier dimensionality reduction method (pre-UMAP)
- Very popular in genomics and single-cell analysis
- Focuses heavily on preserving local structure

**How it Works:**
- Converts high-D distances to probability distributions
- Optimizes low-D representation to match these distributions
- Uses Student's t-distribution in low-D space

**Advantages:**
- Excellent at revealing local clusters
- Widely used and well-understood
- Good for visualization

**Disadvantages:**
- **Much slower than UMAP** (O(N²) complexity)
- **Poor at preserving global structure**
- **Stochastic** - different runs give different results
- **Crowding problem** - struggles with high-D data
- Not suitable for >10,000 sequences

**When to Use:**
- Small to medium datasets (<5,000 sequences)
- When only local clusters matter
- Historical comparison with older studies

**R Implementation:**
```r
library(Rtsne)
tsne_result <- Rtsne(sequence_matrix, 
                     dims = 2, 
                     perplexity = 30,
                     max_iter = 1000)
```

### 2. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

**Description:**
- Classical linear dimensionality reduction
- Projects data onto principal components (directions of maximum variance)

**How it Works:**
- Compute covariance matrix of features
- Find eigenvectors (principal components)
- Project data onto top 2 eigenvectors

**Advantages:**
- **Fast** - O(N) complexity
- **Deterministic** - always same result
- **Interpretable** - PCs have clear mathematical meaning
- **Global structure** - preserves large-scale relationships well

**Disadvantages:**
- **Linear** - assumes linear relationships
- **Poor for complex manifolds** - misses non-linear patterns
- Often doesn't separate clusters as clearly
- First 2 PCs may not capture enough variance

**When to Use:**
- Quick exploratory analysis
- Data with linear structure
- When you need deterministic results
- Preprocessing before other methods

**R Implementation:**
```r
pca_result <- prcomp(sequence_matrix, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
plot(pca_result$x[,1], pca_result$x[,2])
```

### 3. MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)

**Description:**
- Places points in low-D space to preserve pairwise distances
- Classical method predating PCA

**Types:**
- **Classical MDS**: Equivalent to PCA on distance matrix
- **Metric MDS**: Preserves actual distances
- **Non-metric MDS**: Preserves rank order of distances

**Advantages:**
- **Works directly with distance matrices** - good for sequence alignments
- **Preserves global distances** well
- **Deterministic** (classical MDS)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Slow** for large datasets - O(N³)
- **Linear** assumptions (classical MDS)
- **May not separate clusters** as clearly as UMAP/t-SNE

**When to Use:**
- You have pre-computed distance matrix
- Global distance preservation is critical
- Small to medium datasets

**R Implementation:**
```r
dist_matrix <- dist(sequence_matrix)
mds_result <- cmdscale(dist_matrix, k = 2)
```

### 4. Hierarchical Clustering + Dendrogram

**Description:**
- Creates tree structure showing relationships
- Not strictly dimensionality reduction, but serves similar purpose

**How it Works:**
- Agglomerative: Start with individual points, merge closest
- Divisive: Start with all points, recursively split
- Creates hierarchical tree (dendrogram)

**Advantages:**
- **Shows hierarchical relationships** explicitly
- **Natural for taxonomic data** (matches phylogenetic trees)
- **Deterministic**
- **No dimensionality choice** needed

**Disadvantages:**
- **Difficult to visualize** for >100 sequences
- **No 2D spatial layout** - harder to see clusters
- **Doesn't scale** to tens of thousands of sequences

**When to Use:**
- Small datasets (<200 sequences)
- When hierarchy is important
- Supplementary to 2D projections

**R Implementation:**
```r
hc <- hclust(dist(sequence_matrix), method = "ward.D2")
plot(hc)
```

### 5. PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding)

**Description:**
- Newer method (2019) using diffusion geometry
- Preserves both local and global structure
- Specifically designed for biological data

**How it Works:**
- Constructs diffusion operator on data
- Computes potential distances via heat diffusion
- Embeds using these distances

**Advantages:**
- **Excellent for continuous processes** (differentiation, trajectories)

**When to Use:**
- Data with continuous transitions
- When trajectory/branching structure exists
- Developmental or temporal data

**R Implementation:**
```r
library(phateR)
phate_result <- phate(sequence_matrix)
```

### 6. Isomap (Isometric Mapping)

**Description:**
- Non-linear dimensionality reduction using geodesic distances
- Extends MDS to non-linear manifolds

**How it Works:**
- Construct k-nearest neighbor graph
- Compute geodesic distances (shortest path on graph)

**Advantages:**
- **Preserves geodesic distances** on manifold
- **Better than PCA** for non-linear data
- **Deterministic**

**Disadvantages:**
- **Sensitive to noise** and outliers
- **Slower** than PCA/UMAP
- **Can fail** if manifold is not well-sampled
