* Outside of simulated data, p-values cannot be taken at face value
**without careful scrutiny of the data in every case**.  q-values even less so.
   - In omic scale analyses it has not been possible to carefully examine
modeling assumptions for every feature (when modeling is at the feature level).
AI may change this.
   - The shape of the distribution can be examined to ensure that it meets expectations.

<p><p/>
* p/q values may still provide useful guides for the purpose of ordering and
selecting features, but some checks must be put in place to verify that
this is the case. 

<p><p/>
* Theoretical properties of summaries can provide guidance for the design of
analysis steps or components but they get their value from the properties
they confer to the procedures.
   - ie. the q-value filter is correct if the resulting procedure 
achieves a good balance between sensitivity and specificity,
 
<p><p/>
* For the purpose of discovery or feature identification,
it is the distribution of the summaries over the study dataset that matters most.
   - Is the distribution of values of a statistic used to filter or select
features peaked, flat, heavy-tailed.
   - Is the shape consistent with expectations.

<p><p/>
* In high throughput analysis, including genomics, unwanted shared variability
among features is to be expected.  An analysis is incomplete if it does not
include a careful examination at the data to detect any sign of unwanted variability.
See the RUV literature  [@Molania:2023aa; @Gerard:2021aa; @Jiang:2023aa].

* The statistical standard errors of measurement, or the sampling errors, are only
one source of variability in data collected in a high throughput
massively parallel fashion.  Other sources of variability such as
reagent lots, instruments, operators, days (ie. day to day but not otherwise
specified) will often dominate the variability.
   - The Bin Yu Group [@Yu:2024aa;Yu:2020aa;Yu:2013aa;Yu:2018aa] suggests the use of
stability as a more comprehensive or inclusive measure of variability to monitor
and optimize by study design or parameter setting.
