# SPLASH and OASIS: Reference-Free Genomic Analysis
## A Statistical Framework for Biological Discovery

---

## Overview

**SPLASH** (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing) + **OASIS** (Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure) = A unified approach for reference-free genomic analysis

### Key Innovation
- Direct analysis of raw sequencing data without reference genomes
- Statistically rigorous framework with finite-sample validity
- Interpretable results with biological meaning

---

## The Problem with Current Approaches

### Traditional Genomics Workflow
1. **Reference Alignment** → Computational bottleneck
2. **Chi-squared (χ²) Test** → Statistical limitations
3. **Post-hoc Analysis** → No built-in interpretability

### Limitations of χ² Test
- **No finite-sample validity** - relies on asymptotic approximations
- **High sensitivity to noise** - rejects null for biologically uninteresting reasons
- **No interpretability** - doesn't explain WHY the null was rejected
- **Computational intensity** - requires full alignment pipeline

---

## SPLASH: The Data Processing Engine

### Core Concept: Anchor-Target Pairs
- **Anchor**: Fixed k-mer sequence (k=27 by default)
- **Target**: Variable k-mer at fixed offset downstream
- Creates contingency tables automatically from raw reads

### Biological Applications Detected
1. **Viral strain mutations** (SARS-CoV-2, M. tuberculosis)
2. **Alternative splicing** (single-cell level)
3. **Immune receptor diversity** (B/T cell receptors)
4. **Tissue-specific isoforms** (cross-species)
5. **Environmental variation** (seasonal, geographic)

---

## OASIS: The Statistical Framework

### Why OASIS over χ²?

#### P-value Characteristics
**Most Appealing**: **Finite-sample validity** + **Speed**
- Closed-form P-value bounds (no simulation needed)
- Valid for ANY number of observations
- Computationally efficient (no alignment required)

**Essential Characteristic**: **Robustness to unwanted variability**
- Focuses on structured deviations
- Averages out unstructured noise
- Biologically meaningful results

### Mathematical Foundation
```
OASIS Test Statistic: S = f^T X̃ c
```
Where:
- X̃ = centered and normalized contingency table
- f = row embedding (binary: 0/1)
- c = column embedding (continuous)

---

## Handling Unwanted Variability

### The Problem in High-Throughput Data
- **Technical noise** from sequencing errors
- **Batch effects** from experimental conditions  
- **Overdispersion** from biological sampling
- **Contamination** from mixed samples

### OASIS Solution: Structured vs Unstructured Deviations

#### Structured (Biologically Meaningful)
- Strain differences
- Cell-type specific expression
- Developmental stages
- Treatment responses

#### Unstructured (Technical Noise)
- Random sequencing errors
- Low-count artifacts
- Equipment variation
- Sample contamination

**Key Insight**: OASIS computes bilinear forms that average out unstructured noise while amplifying structured biological signals.

---

## Biological Interpretability

### Built-in Decomposition
Unlike χ² which only provides a rejection decision, OASIS provides:

1. **Sample Groupings** (via column embeddings c)
   - Which samples cluster together?
   - What biological conditions are similar?

2. **Feature Importance** (via row embeddings f)
   - Which genomic regions drive the differences?
   - What biological processes are involved?

3. **Effect Size Measures**
   - Magnitude of biological differences
   - Confidence in biological relevance

### Real Biological Examples

#### SARS-CoV-2 Strain Detection
- **100% accuracy** distinguishing Omicron vs Delta
- **No reference genome** required
- **No metadata** needed
- Automatically identifies strain-defining mutations

#### Single-Cell Applications
- **Cell-type specific** alternative splicing
- **HLA allele-specific** expression patterns
- **Immune receptor diversity** detection

## Critical Assessment: Why χ² is an Inadequate Comparator

### The Problem with χ² as Benchmark
**χ² represents 1990s methodology** - not current best practices in genomics:

❌ **No count transformation** (log, variance stabilization)  
❌ **No normalization** (library size, composition bias)  
❌ **No batch effect correction** (technical confounders)  
❌ **Raw count assumptions** (Poisson vs. negative binomial)  

### What Should Have Been Compared: Modern RNA-seq Methods

#### Appropriate Comparators (Risso et al. 2014 framework):
1. **DESeq2** - Negative binomial GLMs with size factor normalization
2. **edgeR** - Empirical Bayes moderated t-tests  
3. **limma-voom** - Variance modeling + linear models
4. **RUVSeq** - Remove Unwanted Variation methods
5. **sva/ComBat** - Surrogate variable analysis

#### Standard RNA-seq Pipeline:
```
Raw Counts → Filtering → Normalization → Transformation → 
Batch Correction → Differential Analysis → Multiple Testing
```

### Missing Benchmarking Components

#### What's Missing from OASIS Evaluation:
1. **Comprehensive benchmark datasets** (not cherry-picked examples)
2. **Objective performance metrics** beyond p-values
3. **Comparison with state-of-the-art** RNA-seq methods
4. **Real data validation** across multiple studies
5. **Computational scalability** assessment

### Performance Comparison: Current Limitations

| Aspect | Current Paper | What's Needed |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Comparator** | χ² test (outdated) | DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom |
| **Data Selection** | Curated examples | Comprehensive benchmarks |
| **Metrics** | P-values only | Sensitivity, specificity, FDR |
| **Validation** | Selected datasets | Multiple independent studies |
| **Scalability** | Not assessed | Runtime, memory, large-scale |

## Statistical Framework Details

### Finite-Sample P-value Bound
```
P(|S| ≥ s) ≤ 2 exp(-2s²/(1-γ))
```
- **γ** measures similarity between column embedding and sample counts
- **Valid for any number of observations**
- **No distributional assumptions**

### Asymptotic Distribution
Under null hypothesis:
```
S ~ N(0, σ²f ||c||²)
```
- Matches finite-sample bounds asymptotically
- Enables power calculations
- Provides theoretical foundation
