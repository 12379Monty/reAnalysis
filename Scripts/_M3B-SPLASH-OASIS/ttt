## Genomics today: distorting biological signal$^1$ ?

- Operating in a paradigm designed for a different era of data and sampling
- Not fully statistical or mathematical
- No unification across "microniches" of biology
- Reference-dependent; Missing biology
- (Computationally intensive)
- Not AI ready

> Current paradigms limit discovery

## Why We Need a Reference-Free Approach

- **Reference genomes have fundamental limitations**:
  - Incomplete representation of genetic diversity
  - Missing sequences from understudied populations
  - Poor handling of highly variable regions

- **Alignment-based approaches**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - Struggle with repetitive elements 
  - Limit discovery of novel biology; Cannot detect what's not in the reference

- **The SPLASH solution**: Direct statistical analysis of raw sequence data using **anchor-target structure**

---

## Why the Anchor-Target Structure Works

- **Biological signal is inherently structured**:
  - Variation occurs in specific patterns adjacent to conserved regions
  - Most biological variation follows this pattern:
    - Alternative splicing: constant exons with variable junctions
    - Genetic variants: stable regions with point mutations
    - Microbial diversity: conserved genes with variable regions

---

## Why the Anchor-Target Structure Works

- **Statistical power through structure**:
  - Anchors provide context for variation
  - Targets capture the biologically meaningful differences
  - Enables detection of patterns without prior knowledge
  - Works across diverse biological domains

- **Unified mathematical framework**:
  - Contingency tables of anchor-target $pairs^1$
  - Same approach applies to viruses, human cells, non-model organisms

## The Problem with Traditional Genomic Analysis

- **Reference-dependent workflows limit discovery**
  - References may be incomplete, misassembled, or nonexistent for less-studied organisms
  - Genetic variants from understudied populations often missing from references
  - High-diversity regions (e.g., HLA in humans) poorly represented

- **Computational inefficiency**
  - Alignment to references is computationally expensive
  - Limited scalability for large datasets

- **Poor handling of**:
  - Paralogs and repetitive elements
  - Diseases like cancer defined by deviation from reference
  - Viral and microbial diversity

## SPLASH: The Fundamental Concept

![SPLASH Concept Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=SPLASH+Concept+Diagram)

- **S**tatistically **P**rimary a**L**ignment **A**gnostic **S**equence **H**oming
- Directly analyzes raw sequencing data
- Detects sample-specific sequence variation without alignment
- Unifies detection of multiple forms of sequence variation

---

## SPLASH: How It Works

1. **Extract k-mers (anchors and targets)**
   - Anchor: fixed sequence (k nucleotides long)
   - Target: adjacent sequence (also k nucleotides)

2. **Build contingency tables**
   - Rows: Different targets
   - Columns: Different samples/conditions
   - Cells: Counts of anchor-target pairs

3. **Apply statistical test**
   - Originally used chi-squared test
   - Now uses OASIS for more robust results
   - Identifies statistically significant sample-specific variation

---

## Why OASIS Instead of Chi-Squared?

- **Limitations of Chi-Squared Test**:
  - Requires large sample sizes for asymptotic validity
  - Poor performance with sparse contingency tables
  - Limited interpretability

- **OASIS Advantages**:
  - Provides valid finite-sample bounds
  - Computationally efficient
  - Offers closed-form P-value calculations
  - Better statistical power
  - More interpretable results

---

## OASIS: Mathematical Framework

- **Linear test statistic** in the normalized data matrix
- Closed-form P-value bounds through concentration inequalities
- Optimizes for both statistical power and interpretability
- Provides decomposition of the table for understanding which elements contribute to rejection of the null hypothesis

---

## Biological Relevance: Applications

- **Viral genomics**: Identifying strain-defining mutations in SARS-CoV-2
  - No reference or strain metadata needed

- **Single-cell transcriptomics**: Discovering regulated RNA isoforms
  - Cell-type specific alternative splicing
  - HLA polymorphism detection

- **Non-model organisms**: Finding biology not in reference genomes
  - Tissue-specific transcripts in octopus
  - Seasonal variation in eelgrass

- **Microbial genomics**: Detecting mobile genetic elements and CRISPR arrays
  - Rapid strain typing

---

## Example 1: SARS-CoV-2 Variant Detection

![SARS-CoV-2 Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=SARS-CoV-2+Analysis)

- **Discovery process**:
  - SPLASH identified anchors with sample-specific targets across SARS-CoV-2 sequences
  - Without reference genome or metadata, detected strain-defining mutations
  
- **Anchor-target advantage**:
  - Anchors located in conserved regions (same across strains)
  - Targets captured variant-specific mutations
  - Statistical testing showed which variants were significantly associated with different samples/timepoints
  
- **Biological insight**:
  - Protein domain profiling revealed key affected proteins (spike, ORF7a, etc.)
  - Detected mutations in functional domains like receptor binding domain
  - Clustered samples by strain without prior knowledge of strain definitions

---

## Example 2: Single-Cell RNA Alternative Splicing

![Single-Cell Splicing](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Single-Cell+Splicing)

- **Discovery process**:
  - SPLASH applied to Smart-Seq2 single-cell RNA-seq data
  - Identified cell-type specific splicing without requiring reference transcriptome
  
- **Anchor-target advantage**:
  - Anchors captured exon-exon junctions
  - Different targets represented alternative splice events
  - Target distribution patterns revealed cell-type specificity
  
- **Biological insight**:
  - Detected known MYL6 alternative splicing as validation
  - Discovered previously unrecognized splicing events
  - Identified cell-type specific expression of HLA-DRB1 vs HLA-DRB4 paralogs
  - Revealed single-cell level variation in HLA-B allele expression

  - Limited benchmarks that don't reflect real-world complexity
  - Overfitting to specific test cases
  - Lack of diverse metrics to evaluate performance

- **A holistic assessment framework should include**:
  - Datasets reflecting end-to-end process variability
  - Samples from varied sources and conditions
  - Battery of meaningful metrics measuring field performance
  - Comprehensive comparison with all competing methods
  - Evaluation of both statistical power and biological relevance

- **Beyond accuracy**: Assessment must consider computational efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability to new biological contexts
