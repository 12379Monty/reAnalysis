## Genomics today: distorting a signal foundational to biological discovery and medicine?

- Operating in a paradigm designed for a different era of data and sampling
<span style="color:grey;">
- Not fully statistical or mathematical
</span>
- No unification across "microniches" of biology
- Reference-dependent
- Missing biology
- (Computationally intensive)
- Not AI ready

> Current paradigms limit discovery and are not designed for today's data scale

Note that the alignment of reads to a known sequence has
unstated data quality value - garbeg reads don't align.

---

## Why We Need a Reference-Free Approach

- **Reference genomes have fundamental limitations**:
  - Incomplete representation of genetic diversity
  - Missing sequences from understudied populations
  - Poor handling of highly variable regions

- **Alignment-based approaches**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - Struggle with repetitive elements (54% of hg)
  - Cannot detect what's not in the reference
  - Limit discovery of novel biology

- **The SPLASH solution**: Direct *statistical analysis*
of raw sequence data using anchor-target structure

---

## Why the Anchor-Target Structure Works

- **Biological signal is inherently structured**: - the centrsl od=
  - Variation occurs in specific patterns adjacent to conserved regions
  - Most biological variation follows this pattern:
    - Alternative splicing: constant exons with variable junctions
    - Genetic variants: stable regions with point mutations
    - Microbial diversity: conserved genes with variable regions

---

- **Statistical power through structure**:
  - Anchors provide context for variation
  - Targets capture the biologically meaningful differences
  - Enables detection of patterns without prior knowledge
  - Works across diverse biological domains

- **Unified mathematical framework**:
  - *Contingency tables* of anchor-target pairs
  - Same approach applies to viruses, human cells, non-model organisms

> we are interested in comparing distributions between samples.
> The data has the shape of a contingency table, but is it analogous?

---

We need to define, and examine power.

## SPLASH: The Fundamental Concept

![SPLASH Concept Diagram](images/svg/splash_concept_static.png)

---

- **S**tatistically **P**rimary a**L**ignment **A**gnostic **S**equence **H**oming
- Directly analyzes raw sequencing data
- Detects sample-specific sequence variation without alignment
- Unifies detection of multiple forms of sequence variation

---

## SPLASH: How It Works

1. **Extract k-mers (anchors and targets)**
   - Anchor: fixed sequence (k nucleotides long)
   - Target: adjacent sequence (also k nucleotides)

2. **Build contingency tables**
   - Rows: Different targets
   - Columns: Different samples/conditions
   - Cells: Counts of anchor-target pairs

3. **Apply statistical test**
   - Originally used chi-squared test; Now uses IASIUS
   - Identifies **statistically significant** sample-specific variation

---

## Limitations of Current Statistical Tests

- **Pearson's chi-squared test** requires expected cell counts ≥5 for valid inference
  - Unreliable for sparse tables common in genomic data
  - Provides little insight into *which* rows/columns drive differences
  - Computationally inefficient for large tables

- **Log-linear models**:
  - Limited by asymptotic approximations
  - Require iterative procedures that may not converge
  - Poor performance with sparse data

- **Exact tests** (Fisher's, Barnard's, etc.):
  - Computationally prohibitive for large tables
  - Often too conservative for genomic applications
  - Limited interpretability

- **Permutation-based approaches**:
  - Computationally expensive
  - May not provide closed-form p-values
  - Challenging to scale to large datasets

---

## Mathematical Formulation of OASIS

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 1](images/svg/oasis_math_1_problem_setup.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 2](images/svg/oasis_math_2_test_statistic.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 3](images/svg/oasis_math_3_optimization.png)

---

![OASIS Mathematical Formulation 4](images/svg/oasis_math_4_comparison.png)

---

- **Problem setup**: Given contingency table $N = [n_{i,j}]$ with row sums $r_i$ and column sums $c_j$
  - Rows represent targets (sequences)
  - Columns represent samples/conditions
  - Cells contain counts of anchor-target pairs

- **Test statistic**: 
  $$T(N) = \max_{f, c} \frac{f^T (P - P_0) c}{\sqrt{f^T \text{diag}(P_0 c) f}}$$

  Where:
  - $P$ is the column-normalized table: $p_{i,j} = \frac{n_{i,j}}{c_j}$
  - $P_0$ is the independence model: $p^0_{i,j} = \frac{r_i}{n}$
  - $f$ and $c$ are vectors to be optimized

---

- **Interpretation**: Measures deviation from independence model, optimized for maximum statistical power


> What is the trade off between power ans size?

> Seems likely dependent in dataset size

---

## Optimization-Based Approach to $f$ and $c$

- **Mathematical objective**:
  - Find vectors $f$ and $c$ that maximize the test statistic $T(N)$
  - Must handle high-dimensional, sparse data efficiently
  - Need interpretable results for biological insight

---

- **Optimization method**:
  - OASIS uses singular value decomposition (SVD) of normalized residual matrix
  - $f$ is the left singular vector corresponding to largest singular value
  - $c$ is the right singular vector corresponding to largest singular value

- **Computational advantages**:
  - Closed-form solution via SVD
  - Highly efficient even for large tables
  - *Provable guarantees on statistical power*

---

## OASIS in Practice: Example Computation

Given a contingency table of anchor-target pairs across samples:

1. **Normalize the table** by column sums to get matrix $P$
2. **Compute expected counts** under independence model $P_0$
3. **Apply SVD** to the normalized residual matrix $(P - P_0)$
4. **Extract vectors** $f$ and $c$ from first singular vectors
5. **Compute test statistic** $T(N)$ using optimized $f$ and $c$
6. **Calculate p-value** using closed-form bounds or asymptotic distribution

This approach provides both *statistical rigor* and *biological interpretability*.

## Conclusion: A New Paradigm which may or may not...

- **Unified approach** to genomic analysis
- **Reference-free discovery** enables novel findings
- **Statistical rigor** through OASIS methodology
- **Computationally efficient** analysis at scale
- **Biologically interpretable** results
- **Future directions**: Expanding to additional omics technologies

---

## Need for More Rigorous Assessments

- **Current evaluation approaches are insufficient for omics-scale methods**:
  - Limited benchmarks that don't reflect real-world complexity

   - need a battery of objective benchmarks
which reflect meaningful endpoints
 
- **A holistic assessment framework should include**:
  - Datasets reflecting end-to-end process variability
  - Samples from varied sources and conditions
  - Battery of meaningful metrics measuring field performance
  - Comprehensive comparison with all competing methods
  - Evaluation of both statistical power and biological relevance

---

## TO DO

- Everything that this study glossed over -
variability regimes which come with the omic territory

- PNAS paper has 100 pages of theory
