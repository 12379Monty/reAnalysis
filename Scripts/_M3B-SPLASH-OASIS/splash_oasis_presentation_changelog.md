## Version 1.1.0 - Example Applications

**Date:** May 26, 2025

### Added
- Added dedicated slides for each example application from the SPLASH paper:
  - SARS-CoV-2 variant detection
  - Single-cell RNA alternative splicing
  - Octopus tissue-specific transcripts
  - Eelgrass geographic and seasonal variation
- Enhanced descriptions of how anchor-target structure enabled each discovery

## Version 2.0.0 - Interactive Visualizations

**Date:** May 26, 2025

### Added
- Created interactive visualizations for key concepts:
  - `splash_concept_diagram`: Visual explanation of SPLASH methodology
  - `performance_comparison`: Interactive comparison of OASIS vs Chi-squared test
  - `sarscov2_analysis`: Interactive visualization of SARS-CoV-2 analysis
  - `single_cell_splicing`: Interactive visualization of cell-type specific splicing
  - `octopus_transcripts`: Interactive visualization of tissue-specific transcripts
  - `eelgrass_analysis`: Interactive visualization of geographic/seasonal variation

### Changed
- Updated presentation to reference interactive visualizations

## Version 2.1.0 - Added Core Context Slides

**Date:** May 26, 2025

### Added
- Added slide "Genomics today: distorting a signal foundational to biological discovery and medicine?" based on Dr. Salzman's CGSI 2024 talk
- Added slide "Why We Need a Reference-Free Approach" explaining limitations of reference-based genomics
- Added slide "Why the Anchor-Target Structure Works" explaining the fundamental insight from Henderson 2024
- Created new visualization `anchor_target_structure` showing how this approach captures different types of biological variation

### Changed
- Reorganized presentation flow to establish problem context before introducing solutions
- Enhanced descriptions of statistical methodology

## Version 2.3.0 - Final Revisions

**Date:** May 26, 2025

### Added
- Added slide "Limitations of Current Statistical Tests" summarizing shortcomings of chi-squared, log-linear models, exact tests, and permutation-based approaches
- Added slide "Need for Comprehensive Assessment Methods" detailing requirements for proper evaluation of omics-scale methods
- Enhanced conclusion with recommendations for holistic assessment

### Changed
- Changed subtitle from "Next-Generation Genomic Analysis" to "Reference-Free Genomic Analysis"
