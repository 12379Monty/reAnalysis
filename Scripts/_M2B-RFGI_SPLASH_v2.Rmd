the paper.
-->

# General Remarks 

## On End to End Omic Scale Analysis {-}

<p><p/>
* Omic scale data refers to measurements taken in parallel over many features -
from thousands of genes to millions of proteins.  Even though the result of
interest, gene scores for example, may be obtained from analyzing
features one at a time, the success of the design and analysis methods
can only be assessed by taking a holistic look at the study data and results.

* To have a holistic picture, the assessment must start with the input material
and follow the sample set through all of the processing steps including QC assessment
and filtering (if any), sample pre-processing  (further filtering and normalization),
data analysis (compute the desired results and report the findings).

* The publications provided the information needed to
show that the technology works in principle, but to be able to appreciate
how well the technology will work in practice, it has to be evaluated 
in a way that fully reflects the  expected usage.

* Having good comparator analysis methods is helpful, if not crucial.  I'm not sure that
the chi-square test provides a good comparator.  I don't recall ever coming 
across the chi-square test in the course of RNA-Seq related analyses, but
my experience is limited to comparing gene expression levels across samples.
There are a number of R packages which treat compositional data analysis
which is analogous to the problem addressed in SPLASH.  Many options 
are listed in Section \@ref(rna-seq-wi-samp); it should be possible to customize one or more
to provide a comparator for SPLASH+OASIS.

* Having a good dataset for assessment
is also critical and could include control features, control samples,
and samples providing engineered or designed truth.
In addition to having built-in truth, the samples used to assess
performance must also be representative of the actual samples
which will be processed in production.

<br/>

## On inferential frameworks   {-}


* An important feature of the SPLASH+OASIS data analyses pipeline is the
finite sample valid statistical inference that it makes possible whereas other
methods rely on asymptotically valid estimates. The value that this feature confers to 
the method should be verified empirically with a proper omic level assessment.  Note that RNA-Seq
methods rely heavily in these asymptotically valid estimates which have not been found
to be problematic for small sample sizes  as the site-specific estimates are typically
stabilized by shrinkage.


* From a personal perspective I feel that the write-up of the papers puts a lot of stock
in p- and q-values.  The statistical standard errors of measurement, or the sampling errors,
are only one source of variability in data collected in a high throughput, massively
parallel fashion. Other sources of variability such as reagent lots, instruments,
operators, days (ie. day to day variability is variability that is not otherwise specified)
will often dominate the total variability.  

* In practice we select the analysis method which
produces the best results as ascertained by omic scale assessments of accuracy.

<br/>

## Outline  {-}

<p><p/>
* The [Salzman Lab](https://salzmanlab.stanford.edu/) 
develop and apply new **statistical algorithms** for **biological inference**
on fundamental questions in the evolution of genomes.

<p><p/> 
* Here we consider 2 papers from the [Salzman Lab](https://salzmanlab.stanford.edu/):
   - SPLASH: 
A statistical, reference-free genomic algorithm unifies biological discover
[PDF](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(23)01179-0.pdf),
[Code](https://github.com/refresh-bio/SPLASH) [@Chaung:2023aa]
   - OASIS: 
An interpretable, finite-sample valid alternative to Pearson’s X2 
for scientific discovery
[URL](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304671121),
[Code](https://github.com/refresh-bio/SPLASH) [@Baharav:2024aa]

<p><p/>
* In the first section RNA-Seq methods for analyzing
the variability of  w/i Sample Rel Abundance
across samples are listed for reference.
   - would these be good options to use as comparators 
to OASIS on a genomic scale assessment?

<p><p/>
* In the first section RNA-Seq methods for analyzing
* In the next two sections  go over the data and analyses described in
the  SPLASH and OASIS papers

<p><p/>
* The rest of the report explores the use of various  GPT tools to produce literature reviews
relevant to Reference-Free Genomic Inference and Tests for Contingency Tables.


<!--
<p><p/>
* In the following sections we survey the scientific literature in order to
situate the two papers SPLASH and OASIS

<p><p/>
* The latte part of the report is divided into two parts, one focusing
on each paper: SPLASH, OASIS

* Each part is further separated into 
3  sections:
   -  a review of the relevant literature prior
to the paper, 
   - a review of the paper itself, and
   - a review of  relevant literature following the publications of the 
paper (SPLASH only as OASIS is too new).

# RNA-Seq w/i Sample Rel Abundance  {#rna-seq-wi-samp}


## chatGPT

* Query:
   - what are RNA-Seq methods to compare across samples the within sample relative expression

* **Response**

When comparing across samples to assess **within-sample relative expression** (comparing how the proportion or relative abundance of genes within a sample changes across multiple samples), the analysis shifts from traditional absolute differential expression testing toward methods designed for compositional or proportion-based data analysis.

### **Key Concept**: {-}
RNA-seq counts represent compositional data (relative abundances), especially after normalization. Therefore, comparing the **within-sample relative abundances** across samples involves methods that account explicitly for compositionality.

---

**Methods for Comparing Within-Sample Relative Expression Across Samples:**

### **1. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA):** {-}

RNA-seq counts can be explicitly analyzed as compositional data, considering genes' relative abundance (proportions within each sample).

- **ALDEx2** (Analysis of differential abundance taking compositionality into account):
  - Uses a Bayesian framework and log-ratio transformations (CLR, centered log-ratio).
  - Designed specifically to identify differentially abundant (relative) features across groups of samples.
  - R package: [`ALDEx2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html)

- **ANCOM-BC**:
  - ANCOM (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes) adapted for RNA-seq and microbiome data.
  - Uses log-ratio approach and compositional modeling to infer differences in relative abundance.
  - R package: [`ANCOMBC`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ANCOMBC.html)

---

### **2. Relative Log Expression (RLE)-based methods:** {-}
   
- **DESeq2** normalization via Relative Log Expression (RLE):
  - The standard normalization method in DESeq2 inherently compares relative expression across samples.
  - After normalization, the data reflect relative abundances suitable for relative comparisons.
  - R package: [`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)

---

### **3. Percent or Proportion-based comparisons:** {-}
   
- **Direct Proportion Comparisons**:
  - Convert normalized counts to proportions (counts per gene/total counts per sample) and use statistical tests designed for proportional data (e.g., beta regression).
  - Beta regression (`betareg`) or logistic regression approaches (`glm`) in R can compare proportions across groups.

---

### **4. Quantile or Rank-based Methods:** {-}
   
- **NOISeq**:
  - Uses non-parametric statistics and ranks to compare relative expression within and across samples, without explicit assumptions about absolute expression.
  - R package: [`NOISeq`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NOISeq.html)

---

#### **5. Compositional transformation (CLR, ALR, ILR transformations)**: {-}

Explicit log-ratio transformations of compositional data to perform downstream statistical testing:

- **Centered Log-Ratio (CLR)**:
  \[
  CLR(gene) = \log\left(\frac{count_{gene}}{\text{geometric mean(counts)}}\right)
  \]

- **Additive Log-Ratio (ALR)**:
  \[
  ALR(gene) = \log\left(\frac{count_{gene}}{count_{reference\,gene}}\right)
  \]

After transformation, standard statistical tests (e.g., linear models, ANOVA, linear mixed models) can be applied.

**Example R package for CoDA transformations**: [`compositions`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=compositions)

---

#### **Recommended approach**: {-}
For explicit RNA-seq **relative expression comparisons** across samples, especially if compositionality matters (e.g., microbiome, small RNA-seq libraries, single-cell RNA-seq), use a compositional method like:

- **ALDEx2** or **ANCOM-BC** (recommended)
- CLR-based analysis (compositions package)
- NOISeq (non-parametric, rank-based approach)

These approaches explicitly recognize the compositional nature of RNA-seq data and appropriately model relative abundance.

---

#### Quick Summary Table: {-}

| Method            | Type                        | Strengths                                            | R package example(s)  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **ALDEx2**        | Bayesian CoDA               | Explicitly compositional; robust against sparsity    | `ALDEx2`              |
| **ANCOM-BC**      | Compositional testing       | Handles zero-inflation and compositionality          | `ANCOMBC`             |
| **CLR/ALR/ILR**   | Log-ratio transforms (CoDA) | Flexible; allows conventional statistical methods    | `compositions`        |
| **DESeq2 (RLE)**  | Normalization               | Standard RNA-seq workflow, reflects relative expression implicitly | `DESeq2`      |
| **NOISeq**        | Non-parametric              | Rank-based; minimal assumptions                      | `NOISeq`              |

---

#### **Conclusion:** {-}

The most robust and explicitly compositional methods currently recommended for RNA-seq within-sample relative expression comparisons across multiple samples are **ALDEx2**, **ANCOM-BC**, and log-ratio transformations (CLR).

# SPLASH - Data and Analysis 

<br/>

## Data Desc

<p><p/>
* The goal of SPLASH is to detect sequence variation between a set of samples.

<p><p/>
* Each sample is represented by a separate file of sequencing data (FASTQ).

<p><p/>
* To detect variation (in the sense of genomic sequence differences between samples)
a set of **anchors** - k-mers which appear among the reads - are identified
and combined into a set.

<p><p/>
* A set of **targets** - k-mers which appear among the reads at locations a few loci
down from the anchors - is also compiled.

<p><p/>
* The analysis dataset consists of a set of tables, one for each anchor:
   - The columns of the table correspond to samples
   - The rows of the table correspond to targets
   - The entries in the tables are the number of anchor reads
with the target for each sample.

<p><p/>
*  The goal is to interrogate the read counts in order
to distinghish two scenarios:
   - 1. the reads for all samples were generated by a common source. eg the same biological
units, or units from the same group.
   - 2. the reads for the samples  were generated by more than one source.

<font color="darkgreen">

* What the sampling scheme is deserves some thought, especially if we want to make inference
from p/q-values.

<p><p/>
* Without any further information about the samples in the form of meta-data sample description
we have to assume that the sample set Is the population.
   - in this case p-values are making inference to **re-sampling reads from the samples in the dataset**.

</font>

<br/>

## Feature Score: p-values 

For a fixed anchor, we have a contingency table of counts: rows are targets, 
columns are samples.  The following computation steps are followed:

<br/>
1. **Random Selection Vector (f):**  
   Each target is randomly mapped to values in `{0,1}` with equal probability.

<br/>
2. **Compute Global Mean (\(\hat{m}\)):**  
   Compute the overall mean of all targets across all samples:
\begin{equation}
   \hat{m} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j,k} f_{Z_{j,k}}
(\#eq:global-mean)
\end{equation}

<br/>
3. **Compute Sample Means (\(\hat{m}_j\)):**  
   Calculate the mean within each sample \( j \):
\begin{equation}
   \hat{m}_j = \frac{1}{n_j}\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} f_{Z_{j,k}}
(\#eq:sample-means)
\end{equation}

<br/>
4. **Anchor-Sample Scores (\(S_j\)):**  
   Calculate scores for each sample, scaled by square root of total counts per sample:
\begin{equation}
   S_j = \sqrt{n_j}(\hat{m}_j - \hat{m})
(\#eq:anchor-samples)
\end{equation}


<font color="darkgreen">

<p><p/>
* $S_j$ is a measure in standard units up to a scaler ($\sigma$)  
ignoring the variability in $\hat{m}$, which is an order of magnitude
smaller than variability in $\hat{m_j}$
means
<p><p/>
* the coefficient, $\sqrt{n_j}$ provides an adjusment for differing sample
sizes.  

<p><p/>
* $S_j$ is a measure in standard units up to a scaler ($\sigma$) 

</font>


<br/>
5. **Final Statistic (\(S\)):**  
   Scores from all samples are weighted by a class-assignment vector \( c_j \), and summed to produce a single statistic:
\begin{equation}
   S = \sum_{j=1}^{J} c_j S_j
(\#eq:final-statistic)
\end{equation}



<font color="darkgreen">

<p><p/>
* $S_j$ values in equation \@ref(eq:anchor-samples) are usually scaled
by an estimate of ($\sigma$) which results in a statistic which asymptotically
has a student t distribution.

* This is used to compute p-values which are valid estimates of true tail probabilities
when the counts are high enough.

</font>

<br/>
<br/>

### P-value Bound (Hoeffding's inequality):   {-}

From [Hoeffding's inequality on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality):

> In probability theory, Hoeffding's inequality provides an upper bound 
> on the probability that the sum of bounded independent random variables
> deviates from its expected value by more than a certain amount.

The probability bound (p-value) that the statistic \( S \) exceeds the observed value under the null hypothesis is calculated using Hoeffding’s inequality:
\begin{equation}
P(|S| \geq a) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2a^2}{\sum_j c_j^2 + \frac{(\sum_j c_j\sqrt{n_j})^2}{M}}\right), \quad \text{where} \quad a = \frac{|S|}{2}
(\#eq:pvalue-bound)
\end{equation}

Multiple hypothesis correction is performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) method, ensuring control of false discovery rate (FDR).

***

### SPLASH Effect Size {-}


SPLASH quantifies biological effect size based on the group assignments that yield the smallest p-value. This metric measures the absolute difference between the average target values across two sample groups defined by weights \( c_j = \pm1 \):

\begin{equation}
\left| \frac{1}{\sum_{j \in A_+} n_j}\sum_{j \in A_+} n_j\hat{m}_j - \frac{1}{\sum_{j \in A_-} n_j}\sum_{j \in A_-} n_j\hat{m}_j \right|
(\#eq:effect-size)
\end{equation}


- Where \( A_+ \) and \( A_- \) are the sets of samples assigned by SPLASH with \( c_j = +1 \) or \( c_j = -1 \).
- Effect size ranges from 0 (identical distributions between groups) to 1 (completely disjoint target distributions).

<font color="darkgreen">

* The effect size in Equation \@ref(#eq:effect-size) is expressed as a differenc of ratios.  If the two groups have different sample sizes, the difference is not a good way to combine the 
two.

</font>

***

### Binomial p-value bound for target fraction abundance plots

To statistically quantify visually apparent differences in target abundance (e.g., for dominant targets), SPLASH calculates a binomial p-value:

1. Compute overall frequency \( p \) of a target across all samples.
2. Establish binomial confidence intervals (e.g., 1%–99%) for each sample.
3. Count how many samples fall outside this confidence interval (denoted by \( X \)).
4. Calculate a p-value bound based on binomial probability:
   \[
   P(\text{Binomial}(m, q) \geq X), \quad \text{where} \quad q \leq 0.02
   \]

This statistical method evaluates if observed variations in target frequencies across samples significantly deviate from expected binomial sampling variation.


<font color="darkgreen">

<p><p/>
*  Given successes $S_1, S_2, ..., S_N$ and trials $T_1, T_2, ..., T_N$
to assess binomial variability we could:
   - use the pooled data to estimate a common underlying p, $\hat{p}$
   - for each trial, n, obtain quantiles $q_{01}^n$ and $q_{99}^n$
   - If  $S_n ~ \text{binomial}(T_n, \hat{p})$
then $S_n \in (q_{01}^n, q_{99}^n)$ is a Bernoulli trial with p = 0.02.
   - with $X = #(S_n \notin (q_{01}^n, q_{99}^n))$, 
 $X \sim \text{Binomial}(N, .02)$

<p><p/>
* We can look $P(\text{Binomial}(N, .02) > X_{obs})$ as an indication of the 
likelihood of the tail events if $S_n \sim \text{Binomial}(T_n, p)$.

<p><p/>
* This is a reasonable procedure although: 
   - choosing to look at the 2% tail is somewhat arbitrary
   - the null is $S_n \sim \text{Binomial}(T_n, p)$.  What is the alternative?

<p><p/>
* Without a fully specified alternative hypothesis, we don't have a proper
significance test.

* Literature Review: Statistical Aspects of Reference-Free Genomic Inference

#### Introduction {-}


Traditional genomic analyses typically align sequences to a reference genome. However, reference-free methods have gained traction to overcome inherent biases and limitations associated with reference-based approaches, such as incomplete or biased reference genomes, and challenges in analyzing novel sequences.

#### Overview of Reference-Free Methods {-}

aspects of the mothodologies or any component which is prey to randomness or variability.

<br/>

#### **Response**  {-}

Here is a detailed summary in markdown format, focusing on statistical aspects and methodologies subject to randomness or variability as described in the provided article (Chaung et al., 2023):

**SPLASH: A Statistical, Reference-Free Genomic Algorithm for Biological Discovery  **

##### Summary {-}

###### Overview of SPLASH   {-}
SPLASH (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing) is a statistical and reference-free genomic analysis algorithm designed to detect sample-dependent sequence variation directly from raw sequencing data, without the need for reference genomes or metadata. It addresses limitations inherent to traditional reference-based genomic analyses, such as reference genome incompleteness, misassemblies, and bias, while also significantly reducing computational complexity.

***

<br/>

###### Statistical Methodology and Variability   {-}
**Key statistical aspects include:**

- **k-mer-based variation detection:** SPLASH operates on k-mer pairs called "anchors" (constant subsequences) and their associated "targets" (sequences downstream at a fixed offset). By default, k is 27 but adjustable.
  
<p><p/>
- **Statistical Testing Approach**:
  - SPLASH constructs contingency tables for each anchor, with samples as columns and targets as rows, capturing frequency counts of anchor-target pairs.
  - A flexible statistical test is performed that searches through multiple random splits of the samples and targets, evaluating the most discriminative grouping that minimizes the p-value, indicating the strongest evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e., no variation between samples).
  - The algorithm computes a p-value bound using closed-form solutions derived from Hoeffding’s inequality, thus avoiding the computational cost of permutation tests or resampling methods.
  - The resulting p-values are corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR).

<p><p/>
<font color="darkgreen">
  - What do we believe these p-values to tell us? 
      - clearly they are not "probabilities" from a known distrubution
      - these may still be useful metrics to rank and identify markers
      - in  partricular, where is the randomness coming from?
</font>

<p><p/>
- **Effect Size**:
  - SPLASH provides an "effect size" metric (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating how discretely target distributions differ across sample groups identified by the algorithm. An effect size of 1 indicates that target sets are entirely distinct between groups.

<p><p/>
<font color="darkgreen">
  - We need to think how to interpret this effect size.
      - in the case two groups with continuous measure we may have t = D/se where 
$D = \hat{\mu_2} - \hat{\mu_1}$ is in interpretable units so that one can judge
whether the observed difference is meaningful
      - these may still be useful metrics to rank and identify markers
      - in  particular, where is the randomness coming from?
</font>

<p><p/>
- **Unsupervised and Supervised Modes**:
  - While metadata can be included ("supervised" mode), all analyses presented were conducted in the default unsupervised mode, relying on random splits of samples and targets to identify significant variation.


<p><p/>
<font color="darkgreen">
  - For unsupervised analysis, are there alternatives to the random split
approach. 
</font>


<p><p/>
- **Consensus Sequence Assembly**:
  - For interpretability, SPLASH builds longer consensus sequences from significant anchors, which can then be aligned against known protein domains or reference databases to understand biological functions or genomic context.

***

<br/>

##### Applications and Statistical Highlights   {-}

<font color="darkgreen">
**Hard to interpret** without a comparator and an appropriate measure of closeness
to the truth.
</font>


<br/>

<p><p/>
###### 1. **SARS-CoV-2 Strain Mutation Detection**: {-}
- SPLASH accurately identified variant-specific and emergent mutations (e.g., strain-defining mutations K417N, V213G, N679K, and P681H) in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without using metadata or a reference genome.
- Statistical precision was demonstrated by comparison with reference archetypes (Delta, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2). Nearly all SPLASH anchors perfectly mapped to strain-defining mutations compared to control anchors, showing high statistical significance.

<br/>

<p><p/>
###### 2. Single-cell RNA-seq (Alternative Isoforms & Paralogs)   {-}
- In single-cell RNA-seq data, SPLASH identified regulated alternative splicing and differential paralog expression (e.g., MYL12A vs. MYL12B in macrophages vs. capillary cells), again using only raw reads and no cell-type metadata.
- For highly polymorphic HLA genes (e.g., HLA-DRB1 vs. HLA-DRB4, HLA-DPA1 vs. HLA-DPB1, HLA-B allele-specific expression), SPLASH effectively detected differential expression and isoform usage, with high statistical confidence (low q-values and significant binomial p-values).

<br/>

######  B and T Cell Receptor (BCR/TCR) Diversity: {-}
- SPLASH effectively identified diverse, clonotypic immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences in both human and mouse lemur single-cell RNA-seq datasets without reliance on pre-existing annotations.
- The detected receptor sequences had high "target entropy" (many distinct targets) and were expressed clonotypically, reflecting biologically expected diversity due to V(D)J recombination.

- **Discovery in Non-model Organisms (Octopus and Eelgrass)**:
  - SPLASH uncovered tissue-specific alternative splicing and RNA editing events in octopus RNA-seq data, including previously unannotated isoforms of sensory-relevant genes.
  - For eelgrass (Zostera marina), SPLASH revealed seasonally and geographically regulated variation, including sequences originating from associated diatoms, highlighting ecological interactions and circadian regulation.

<br/>

###### Statistical Robustness and Computational Efficiency: {-}
- SPLASH demonstrated robust performance across parameter settings (k-mer lengths, anchor-target distances).
- Computationally efficient, SPLASH reduces the amount of data needing reference alignment by over 500-fold by focusing alignment only on statistically significant consensus sequences.

**Deeper Dive into SPLASH's Statistical Methodologies**

SPLASH's statistical framework is designed to detect **sequence variation across samples without reference alignment**, making it computationally efficient and broadly applicable. Below, we take a detailed look at its core statistical techniques, including **k-mer based variation detection, contingency table analysis, p-value bounding, false discovery rate control, and effect size computation**.

***

###### **1. K-mer Based Statistical Detection of Variation**  {-}
####### **Concept:** {-}
- SPLASH detects variation by analyzing **k-mers**—subsequences of length *k* within sequencing reads.
- The method identifies **anchors** (stable sequences) and **targets** (variable sequences downstream of the anchor).
- The goal is to determine **whether different samples have different target distributions**, which signals biologically meaningful variation.

###### **Statistical Rationale:** {-}
- Instead of mapping reads to a reference genome, SPLASH **counts occurrences** of k-mer anchor-target pairs.
- Variability is assessed using **contingency tables** that track how often each target appears in different samples.

###### **Randomness & Variability Considerations:** {-}
- **Choice of k**: Default is *k = 27*, ensuring **statistical resolution** while balancing sequencing noise.
- **Effect of sequencing errors**: Short k-mers are susceptible to random sequencing errors, but SPLASH mitigates this by aggregating across multiple read positions.

***

##### **2. Contingency Table Analysis for Sequence Variation** {-}
###### **Concept:** {-}
- For each anchor, SPLASH builds a **contingency table**, where:
  - **Rows** represent **targets** (different k-mer sequences).
  - **Columns** represent **samples** (biological conditions, individuals, or time points).
  - **Entries** contain **the count of each target in each sample**.

- The key question: *Is the target distribution significantly different across samples?*
- SPLASH applies a **statistical test for independence** to determine whether the observed variation is **random noise** or **biologically meaningful**.

###### **Statistical Test Used:** {-}
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Target distributions do not differ across samples (i.e., no sample-specific sequence variation).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Targets differ significantly between samples, indicating biological regulation.

- SPLASH **does not use chi-squared tests**, as these require large counts and normal approximations, which are **problematic for sparse sequencing data**.
- Instead, SPLASH applies a **custom statistical test** that minimizes false positives while maintaining high sensitivity.

###### **Randomness & Variability Considerations:** {-}
- **Sufficient sample size**: If too few samples are available, power is reduced.
- **Sparse contingency tables**: Some targets may have **very low counts**, making statistical inference harder.
- **Multiple hypothesis testing**: Analyzing many k-mer pairs increases the risk of false positives.

##### **3. P-value Bounding for Statistical Efficiency** {-}
###### **Concept:** {-}
- Traditional methods rely on **permutation tests** or **bootstrap resampling** to determine p-values, which are computationally expensive.
- SPLASH instead uses a **closed-form p-value bound**, which is:
  - **Faster to compute** than resampling-based methods.
  - **More robust** to low-count situations.

###### **Statistical Details:** {-}
- The bound is derived using:
  - **Concentration inequalities** (Chernoff bounds) to approximate significance.
  - **Random splits of samples and targets**, selecting the grouping that minimizes the p-value.
- This ensures **statistical rigor** without excessive computational overhead.

###### **Randomness & Variability Considerations:** {-}
- **Avoids overfitting**: Since SPLASH tests multiple random sample splits, it minimizes **selection bias**.
- **Handles rare variations well**: Unlike permutation tests, which can **underestimate false discovery rates**, p-value bounding maintains accuracy.

***

##### **4. False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control** {-}
###### **Concept:** {-}
- Given that SPLASH evaluates thousands of k-mer anchor-target pairs, **multiple testing correction** is crucial to reduce false positives.
- SPLASH employs **FDR control** methods such as **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction** to adjust p-values.

###### **Statistical Approach:** {-}
- **Unadjusted p-values** are ranked from smallest to largest.
- The threshold for statistical significance is determined by:
  \[
  p_{(i)} \leq \frac{i}{m} \alpha
  \]
  where:
  - \( p_{(i)} \) is the *i-th* ranked p-value,
  - \( m \) is the total number of tests,
  - \( \alpha \) is the desired FDR level (e.g., 0.05).

###### **Randomness & Variability Considerations:** {-}
- **FDR is adaptive**: The method dynamically adjusts to sequencing noise.
- **Lower false positives compared to uncorrected p-values**, but at the cost of **some true positives being discarded**.

***

##### **5. Effect Size Computation for Variation Magnitude** {-}
###### **Concept:** {-}
- SPLASH calculates **effect sizes** to measure the magnitude of variation.
- Effect size ranges from **0 to 1**, where:
  - **0** means no variation between samples.
  - **1** means completely different target distributions.

###### **Mathematical Definition:** {-}
- SPLASH's effect size is based on a **distance metric**:
  \[
  d = 1 - \frac{ \sum_{i} \min (p_i, q_i) }{ \sum_{i} p_i + q_i }
  \]
  where:
  - \( p_i \) and \( q_i \) are target frequencies in different sample groups.

- If \( d \approx 0 \), targets are similarly distributed → **No significant variation**.
- If \( d \approx 1 \), targets are distinct across samples → **Biologically meaningful difference**.

###### **Randomness & Variability Considerations:** {-}
- **More robust than p-values**: Unlike p-values, which depend on sample size, effect size remains stable across datasets.
- **Can detect rare but important variations**: Even low-frequency variants with high effect size can be biologically relevant.

***

##### **6. Application to Highly Variable Biological Systems** {-}
###### **Example: Detecting Viral Strain Variants** {-}
- SPLASH applied to **SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data** revealed **strain-specific mutations** without prior knowledge.
- Targets clustered **Omicron vs. Delta vs. Original strains**, validating the statistical approach.
- SPLASH identified:
  - **Mutation K417N** in Omicron.
  - **P681R substitution** in Delta.
  - **Previously unreported emerging mutations**.

###### **Example: Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis** {-}
- SPLASH identified **cell-type-specific expression** in:
  - **HLA genes**, revealing allele-specific expression.
  - **MYL12A/B paralogs**, distinguishing macrophages vs. endothelial cells.
- The method **worked without predefined metadata**, showcasing its power in **unsupervised discovery**.

###### **Example: Immune Receptor Diversity** {-}
- SPLASH discovered **novel V(D)J recombinations** in **B and T cells**.
- It revealed **clonally expanded immune receptors** without a reference genome.

***

##### **Conclusion: Statistical Power of SPLASH** {-}
SPLASH’s **reference-free statistical approach** provides a robust way to analyze genomic variation, particularly in highly diverse and noisy biological datasets. By leveraging:
✔ **k-mer based contingency tables**,  
✔ **Closed-form p-value bounds**,  
✔ **False discovery rate correction**, and  
✔ **Effect size calculations**,  

SPLASH **accurately detects biologically meaningful variation**, making it a powerful tool for **viral surveillance, single-cell transcriptomics, and immune system diversity studies**.

Would you like a deeper look at **specific statistical formulas or implementation details**? 🚀

<br/>
#### **Statistical Formulas**  {-}

**In-Depth Statistical Formulas Used in SPLASH**

SPLASH employs a robust statistical framework designed to detect **sample-specific sequence variation** directly from raw sequencing reads. The key statistical techniques include **contingency table analysis, p-value bounding, effect size computation, and false discovery rate (FDR) correction**. Below, we explore the **exact mathematical formulations** behind these methodologies.

***

##### **1. Contingency Table Analysis** {-}
SPLASH constructs **contingency tables** for each anchor-target pair to evaluate whether observed sequence distributions vary significantly across samples.

###### **Formulation:** {-}
For each anchor **A**, let:
- \( S = \{ S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n \} \) be the set of **n samples**.
- \( T = \{ T_1, T_2, \dots, T_m \} \) be the set of **m targets** (variable sequences).
- \( C_{ij} \) be the **count** of target \( T_i \) in sample \( S_j \).

The contingency table is represented as:

\[
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{11} & C_{12} & \dots & C_{1n} \\
C_{21} & C_{22} & \dots & C_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
C_{m1} & C_{m2} & \dots & C_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

###### **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))** {-}
- The target distributions across samples follow the same underlying probability distribution:
  \[
  P(T_i | S_j) = P(T_i), \quad \forall i, j
  \]
- That is, target variation is purely due to random sampling.

###### **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))** {-}
- The probability distribution of targets **varies significantly** between samples:
  \[
  P(T_i | S_j) \neq P(T_i)
  \]
  for some \( i, j \), indicating **biologically relevant sample-dependent variation**.

###### **Statistical Test for Contingency Table** {-}
SPLASH applies a **divergence measure** to test whether the observed contingency table deviates significantly from what would be expected under \(H_0\).

A commonly used measure is the **Pearson chi-square test**:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{(C_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\]

where:
- \( E_{ij} \) is the expected count under \(H_0\):
  \[
  E_{ij} = \frac{(\sum_k C_{ik}) (\sum_k C_{kj})}{\sum_{k,l} C_{kl}}
  \]
- \( \chi^2 \) follows a chi-square distribution with \( (m-1)(n-1) \) degrees of freedom.

However, since **chi-square tests assume large counts**, SPLASH instead applies **custom p-value bounding methods**, detailed next.

***

##### **2. P-value Bounding for Statistical Efficiency** {-}
Instead of permutation tests, which are computationally expensive, SPLASH computes a **closed-form p-value bound**.

###### **P-value Bound Computation** {-}
SPLASH uses a concentration inequality (Chernoff bound) to bound the probability of deviation from expected target distributions:

\[
P\left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{ij} \geq t \right) \leq e^{- \frac{t^2}{2m n \sigma^2}}
\]

where:
- \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance estimate of the observed target distributions.
- \( t \) is the **observed test statistic** from the contingency table.

###### **Effect of the Bound** {-}
- This avoids computationally expensive resampling.
- It provides an upper bound on the probability that observed deviations occur by chance.

If the bound **falls below a predefined significance threshold (\(\alpha\), typically 0.05)**, the variation is deemed significant.

***

##### **3. Effect Size Computation** {-}
P-values only tell us whether an effect is **statistically significant**, but we also need to measure how **large** the difference is. SPLASH computes **effect sizes** to quantify the magnitude of sequence variation.

###### **Effect Size Formula** {-}
SPLASH uses a **normalized divergence metric**:

\[
D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} \min (P_i, Q_i)}{\sum_{i} P_i + Q_i}
\]

where:
- \( P_i \) and \( Q_i \) are **target frequency distributions** in two sample groups.

###### **Interpretation:** {-}
- \( D = 0 \): No variation (identical target distributions).
- \( D = 1 \): Completely different target distributions.
- \( 0.5 \leq D \leq 1 \): Strong biological differentiation.

***

##### **4. False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control** {-}
Since SPLASH evaluates thousands of anchor-target pairs, multiple hypothesis testing increases the risk of **false positives**. To correct for this, SPLASH applies **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction**.

###### **FDR Correction Formula** {-}
1. Rank unadjusted p-values: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \dots \leq p_m \)
2. Compute threshold:
   \[
   p_{\text{BH}} = \frac{i}{m} \alpha
   \]
   where:
   - \( i \) is the p-value rank.
   - \( m \) is the total number of tests.
   - \( \alpha \) is the desired FDR threshold (e.g., 0.05).
3. Adjusted p-value:
   \[
   p'_i = \min\left( \frac{m}{i} p_i, 1 \right)
   \]

###### **Effect of FDR Correction** {-}
- **Reduces false positives** while maintaining sensitivity.
- Ensures only **statistically robust** anchor-target pairs are reported.

***

##### **5. Application to SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Analysis** {-}
SPLASH’s statistical framework successfully identified **strain-specific mutations** in SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

For example, when analyzing viral sequences from Omicron and Delta strains:
- SPLASH computed **p-value bounds** and **effect sizes** for thousands of k-mer target distributions.
- A **low p-value** (\( < 10^{-5} \)) indicated significant variation in:
  - **Mutation K417N (Omicron-specific)**
  - **Mutation P681R (Delta-specific)**
- The **effect size** for these mutations was close to **1**, confirming strong differentiation between strains.

***

##### **Conclusion: The Power of SPLASH's Statistical Methods** {-}
###### **Key Takeaways** {-}
✅ **Contingency table analysis** determines if target distributions vary significantly.  
✅ **P-value bounding (Chernoff bound)** provides a computationally efficient significance test.  
✅ **Effect size metric** quantifies the biological importance of variation.  
✅ **FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)** ensures statistical robustness.  

Would you like a **worked example with real genomic data** to see how these formulas are applied in practice? 🚀

<br/>

#### Worked Out Example {-}

Let's walk through a **worked example** using **real genomic data** to see how the statistical formulas in SPLASH are applied.

**Example: Detecting Sequence Variation in SARS-CoV-2 Data Using SPLASH's Statistical Framework**

**Scenario:**
We have **sequencing data** from **two different SARS-CoV-2 strains** (Delta and Omicron). Our goal is to use **SPLASH’s statistical methods** to identify significant sequence variations.

***

##### **Step 1: Constructing a Contingency Table** {-}
We analyze **a specific genomic region** where two different **mutations** appear in Delta and Omicron.

We define:
- **Anchor (fixed sequence)**: A conserved **27-mer k-mer** from the Spike protein gene.
- **Targets (variant sequences)**: The **mutated sequences** found in different samples.

Here is a **hypothetical contingency table** for this region:

| **Target (Mutation)** | **Delta Sample 1** | **Delta Sample 2** | **Omicron Sample 1** | **Omicron Sample 2** | **Total** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **K417 (Wildtype)** | 150 | 145 | 0 | 0 | 295 |
| **K417N (Omicron-specific)** | 0 | 0 | 180 | 170 | 350 |
| **P681R (Delta-specific)** | 120 | 110 | 0 | 0 | 230 |
| **P681H (Omicron-specific)** | 0 | 0 | 190 | 180 | 370 |
| **Total Reads** | **270** | **255** | **370** | **350** | **1245** |

---

##### **Step 2: Statistical Test for Target Variability** {-}
We test whether **target distributions** are different between Delta and Omicron.

##### **Null Hypothesis \( H_0 \)** {-}
- Target distributions do not differ across samples (i.e., no significant variation).

###### **Alternative Hypothesis \( H_1 \)** {-}
- Target distributions differ significantly across samples, indicating meaningful **strain-specific mutations**.

###### **Chi-Square Test** {-}
We compute the **expected counts** under \( H_0 \):

\[
E_{ij} = \frac{ (\sum_k C_{ik}) (\sum_k C_{kj}) }{\sum_{k,l} C_{kl}}
\]

For the **K417N mutation (Omicron-specific)**:
- Expected count in **Delta Sample 1**:

  \[
  E_{K417N, Delta1} = \frac{(350 \times 270)}{1245} = 75.96
  \]

- Expected count in **Omicron Sample 1**:

  \[
  E_{K417N, Omicron1} = \frac{(350 \times 370)}{1245} = 104.03
  \]

Now, computing the **Chi-Square statistic**:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{(C_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\]

For the **K417N mutation**:

\[
\frac{(0 - 75.96)^2}{75.96} + \frac{(180 - 104.03)^2}{104.03} = \frac{5772.92}{75.96} + \frac{5772.92}{104.03} = 76.02 + 55.50 = 131.52
\]

Summing over all **mutations**, we get:

\[
\chi^2_{\text{total}} = 452.67
\]

Using a chi-square distribution table with **df = (4-1)(4-1) = 9**, we find:

\[
p \text{-value} \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-40}
\]

###### **Interpretation:** {-}
- Since **p < 0.05**, we **reject \( H_0 \)**.
- The data **strongly supports strain-specific variation**.

***

##### **Step 3: P-value Bounding for Statistical Efficiency** {-}
To **confirm robustness**, we apply a **p-value bound** using **Chernoff's inequality**:

\[
P\left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{ij} \geq t \right) \leq e^{- \frac{t^2}{2m n \sigma^2}}
\]

For our data:
- \( t = 452.67 \)
- \( \sigma^2 \approx 25 \) (estimated variance)
- \( m = 4 \), \( n = 4 \) (number of rows and columns)

\[
P(452.67) \leq e^{- \frac{(452.67)^2}{2(4)(4)(25)}}
\]

\[
= e^{- \frac{204909.93}{200}} = e^{-1024.55} \approx 10^{-445}
\]

###### **Interpretation:** (Worst verbiage ever maybe) {-}
- The probability that **this variation happened by random chance is practically zero**.
- **P-value bounding confirms that our chi-square test is highly significant**.

***

##### **Step 4: Computing Effect Size** {-}
To measure how **strongly** the target distributions differ, we compute **effect size**:

\[
D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} \min (P_i, Q_i)}{\sum_{i} P_i + Q_i}
\]

For **K417N** (Omicron-specific):
- **Delta samples**: \( P_{\text{Delta}} = 0 \)
- **Omicron samples**: \( Q_{\text{Omicron}} = 350 \)

\[
D_{K417N} = 1 - \frac{\min(0, 350)}{0 + 350} = 1 - 0 = 1.0
\]

For **P681R** (Delta-specific):
- **Delta samples**: \( P_{\text{Delta}} = 230 \)
- **Omicron samples**: \( Q_{\text{Omicron}} = 0 \)

\[
D_{P681R} = 1 - \frac{\min(230, 0)}{230 + 0} = 1 - 0 = 1.0
\]

###### **Interpretation:** {-}
- **Effect size = 1** → **Perfect separation** between Delta and Omicron.
- **Effect sizes close to 1 confirm biologically meaningful strain differences**.

***

##### **Step 5: False Discovery Rate (FDR) Correction** {-}
Since we test multiple mutations, we control for **false positives** using **Benjamini-Hochberg correction**.

###### **FDR Adjustment** {-}
1. Rank unadjusted p-values:  
   \( p_1 = 3.5 \times 10^{-40} \), \( p_2 = 5.2 \times 10^{-35} \), \( p_3 = 1.1 \times 10^{-30} \), etc.

2. Compute the **adjusted significance threshold**:

   \[
   p_{\text{BH}} = \frac{i}{m} \alpha
   \]

   - Let \( \alpha = 0.05 \).
   - With **m = 100 tests**, the cutoff for **significance** is:

   \[
   p' = \frac{1}{100} \times 0.05 = 5 \times 10^{-4}
   \]

3. Since all our **p-values are much smaller**, they remain **statistically significant** after correction.

***

##### **Conclusion: Key Findings from Our Statistical Analysis** {-}
✅ **Significant variation in K417N (Omicron) and P681R (Delta)**  
✅ **Effect size of 1 confirms strong biological separation**  
✅ **FDR correction ensures these are not false positives**  

This worked example **demonstrates how SPLASH statistically detects genomic variations** in viral strains, immune genes, and other biological applications.

***


I would like to see **a R-based implementation** of these calculations on real sequencing data.


***

#### **R-based implementation** {-}

* **R-based implementation** to apply **statistical tests** similar to SPLASH on **real sequencing data**.


##### **🔬 Goal: Detect SARS-CoV-2 Strain-Specific Mutations Using SPLASH-Like Statistics** {-}
We will:
1. **Load sequencing data** for mutations in Delta and Omicron strains.
2. **Construct a contingency table** of mutation occurrences.
3. **Perform a Chi-Square test** to detect significant variation.
4. **Compute p-value bounds** using Chernoff’s inequality.
5. **Calculate effect size** to measure the strength of mutation differences.
6. **Adjust for multiple testing** using **False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction**.

***

##### **Step 1: Load Required R Libraries** {-}
```{r m2b-load-libs}
### Install required packages (if not already installed)
###install.packages(c("tidyverse", "stats", "pheatmap"))

### Load libraries
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(stats))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(pheatmap))

```

***

##### **Step 2: Input SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Data** {-}
Here’s a hypothetical dataset where we have sequencing results for **two Delta and two Omicron samples**, showing counts for specific **mutations (targets)**.

```{r m2b-target-vs-samples}
### Mutation occurrence data in different samples
mutation_data <- matrix(c(
  150, 145, 0,   0,   # K417 Wildtype (Delta)
  0,   0,   180, 170, # K417N (Omicron-specific)
  120, 110, 0,   0,   # P681R (Delta-specific)
  0,   0,   190, 180  # P681H (Omicron-specific)
), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

### Assign row and column names
rownames(mutation_data) <- c("K417_Wildtype", "K417N_Omicron", "P681R_Delta", "P681H_Omicron")
colnames(mutation_data) <- c("Delta_Sample1", "Delta_Sample2", "Omicron_Sample1", "Omicron_Sample2")

### Print mutation table
###print(mutation_data)

mutation_data %>%
knitr::kable(
caption = "Mutation occurrence: culumnss are data in different samples"
 ) %>% 
kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

***

##### **Step 3: Compute Chi-Square Test for Target Variation** {-}
We apply a **Chi-Square test** to determine whether target distributions significantly differ between Delta and Omicron samples.

```{r}
### Perform Chi-Square test
chi_sq_test <- chisq.test(mutation_data)

### Print test result
print(chi_sq_test)
```
###### **Interpreting the Output:** {-}
- If **p-value < 0.05**, we **reject \( H_0 \)**, meaning the mutation distribution **significantly differs** between strains.
- **Chi-square statistic** quantifies how much variation exists between Delta and Omicron samples.

***

##### **Step 4: Compute P-Value Bound (Chernoff’s Inequality)** {-}
Instead of resampling, we approximate the p-value bound using **Chernoff’s bound**.

```{r}
## Function to compute Chernoff's bound
chernoff_bound <- function(test_stat, m, n, variance) {
  return(exp(- (test_stat^2) / (2 * m * n * variance)))
}

## Define parameters
variance_est <- 25  # Estimated variance
m <- 4  # Number of mutations
n <- 4  # Number of samples
test_stat <- chi_sq_test$statistic  # Use Chi-Square test statistic

## Compute p-value bound
chernoff_pval <- chernoff_bound(test_stat, m, n, variance_est)

## Print bound
print(paste("Chernoff P-Value Bound: ", chernoff_pval))
```
##### **Interpreting the Output:** {-}
- A **low bound (e.g., \( 10^{-40} \))** confirms **significant variation**.
- This method is **computationally efficient** compared to permutation testing.

***

#### **Step 5: Compute Effect Size** {-}
To quantify how **different** Delta and Omicron are, we compute an **effect size metric**:

\[
D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} \min (P_i, Q_i)}{\sum_{i} P_i + Q_i}
\]



```{r m2b-effect-size-fn, eval = F}
## Compute effect size function
effect_size <- function(mutation_data) {
  total_counts <- rowSums(mutation_data)  # Total counts per mutation
  # BUG - distance should be pairwise
  ###################################
  # we are taking a sample-pair level metric
  ###############################
  min_sums <- rowSums(apply(mutation_data, 1, function(x) min(x[1:2], x[3:4])))  # Minimum values in Delta vs. Omicron

  # Effect size calculation
  D <- 1 - (min_sums / sum(total_counts))
  return(D)
}

## Compute effect sizes
effect_sizes <- effect_size(mutation_data)

## Print effect sizes for each mutation
print(effect_sizes)
```
##### **Interpreting the Output:** {-}
- **Effect size = 1** → Completely distinct mutations between strains.
- **Effect size = 0.5 - 1** → Strong biological difference.
- **Effect size < 0.5** → Moderate or weak separation.

***

#### **Step 6: Apply False Discovery Rate (FDR) Correction** {-}
Since we are testing multiple mutations, we **control false positives** using **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction**.

```{r}
## Apply BH correction for multiple testing
adjusted_p_values <- p.adjust(chi_sq_test$p.value, method = "BH")

## Print adjusted p-values
print(adjusted_p_values)
```
##### **Interpreting the Output:** {-}
- If **adjusted p-value < 0.05**, the mutation remains **statistically significant** after FDR correction.

***

#### **Step 7: Visualize Mutation Distribution** {-}
To **visualize** differences between strains, we plot a **heatmap of mutation counts**.

```{r}
## Create heatmap
pheatmap(mutation_data, 
         cluster_rows = FALSE, 
         cluster_cols = FALSE,
         display_numbers = TRUE,
         color = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(50))
```
##### **Interpreting the Heatmap:** {-}
- **Red** = High occurrence of mutations.
- **Blue** = Low occurrence.
- **Omicron mutations (K417N, P681H) appear in Omicron samples**.
- **Delta mutations (K417 Wildtype, P681R) are absent in Omicron**.

***

#### **📌 Final Interpretation of Results** {-}
| **Test** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Chi-Square Test** | \( p < 0.05 \) | Significant mutation variation between Delta and Omicron. |
| **P-value Bound** | \( 10^{-40} \) | Mutation differences are not due to random chance. |
| **Effect Size** | ~1.0 | Mutations **completely separate** strains. |
| **FDR Correction** | \( p_{\text{adjusted}} < 0.05 \) | The variation is **not a false positive**. |
| **Heatmap** | Clear clustering of mutations by strain | **Omicron and Delta have distinct mutation patterns**. |

***

#### **🎯 Conclusion** {-}
- The **K417N and P681H mutations are exclusive to Omicron**.
- The **P681R mutation is exclusive to Delta**.
- The **statistical methods confirm that these mutations are not random**.
- **SPLASH-style statistics successfully differentiate viral strains without a reference genome!** 🚀

***

Would you like to:
1. **Extend this analysis to real sequencing datasets**? (E.g., FASTQ files)  
2. **Apply machine learning** to predict viral strains based on mutation patterns?

### **Response**  {-}

**Literature Review: Statistical Tests for Contingency Tables**

### Introduction

Contingency tables are a fundamental structure in statistics used to examine the relationship between categorical variables. They are widely applied across domains such as the social sciences, genomics, and biomedical research. While the Pearson chi-squared (χ²) test is historically prominent, modern datasets—often high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy—necessitate more robust and interpretable statistical tools. This review surveys key statistical methods for analyzing contingency tables, with a particular focus on the recently introduced OASIS framework and its application in genomics.

The Pearson χ² test assesses independence by comparing observed and expected frequencies under the null hypothesis. Despite its widespread use, it suffers from several statistical drawbacks:

- Relies on asymptotic approximations, which can be invalid in small-sample or sparse data contexts.
- Lacks robustness to noise and technical artifacts.
- Offers limited interpretability when rejecting the null hypothesis.

These issues often lead to misestimation of p-values and challenges in scientific inference.

### Alternative Methods

#### Log-Linear Models

Log-linear models extend χ² tests by modeling the log of expected counts with interaction terms. While flexible, they assume model correctness and still require large-sample theory for valid inference.

#### Resampling-Based Methods

Permutation and MCMC methods can provide more accurate p-values, but are computationally intensive. They are impractical for large or complex tables, and may still be sensitive to noise.

#### Limited-Information Tests

These focus on lower-dimensional projections (e.g., univariate or bivariate margins), offering some power in high-sparsity settings. However, they lack general interpretability and rely on asymptotics.

### OASIS: A Modern Framework

#### Overview

**OASIS (Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure)** is a novel family of tests designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. Introduced by [@Baharav:2024aa], OASIS:

- Uses a linear test statistic to allow **finite-sample valid p-values**.
- Leverages **concentration inequalities** for closed-form bounds.
- Avoids assumptions of distributional asymptotics.
- Is **robust to overdispersion** and noise, common in genomic data.
- Offers **interpretable decomposition** of results, showing what structure leads to rejection.

#### Technical Highlights

OASIS formulates the test as a bilinear form on a normalized residual matrix. Unlike χ², it does not upweight rare observations, and instead emphasizes structured deviations from the null. The result is a test that is both **more powerful** in certain regimes and **more statistically disciplined**.

#### Comparison with Pearson's χ²

| Feature | Pearson's χ² | OASIS |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| P-values | Asymptotic only | Finite-sample valid |
| Robustness | Sensitive to sparse/low counts | Robust to noise |
| Computation | Simple but approximate | Efficient and rigorous |
| Interpretability | Limited | High |

### Applications in Genomics: SPLASH

#### SPLASH Framework

SPLASH (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing), introduced by [@Chaung:2023aa], applies OASIS to sequencing data to detect variation **without reference genomes** or **metadata**. It works by:

- Identifying "anchors" and "targets" as k-mers in reads.
- Building contingency tables across samples for each anchor.
- Using OASIS to test for differential distribution of targets.

This enables reference-free detection of:

- Viral strain mutations (e.g., SARS-CoV-2)
- Cell-type-specific isoforms and splicing
- Adaptive immune receptor diversity
- Unannotated transcripts in non-model organisms

#### Case Study: SARS-CoV-2

SPLASH was able to detect known and novel strain-defining mutations across patient samples with high specificity and without any metadata. This showcases the power of statistically grounded, reference-free methods enabled by OASIS.

### Conclusion

Statistical tests for contingency tables are evolving to meet the needs of modern, complex datasets. The OASIS framework provides a **statistically valid**, **robust**, and **interpretable** alternative to classical methods, particularly useful in genomics and other high-dimensional fields. Its application in SPLASH demonstrates its practical impact and potential for broader scientific discovery.

#### **Response**  {-}

* Summary of "OASIS: An interpretable, finite-sample valid alternative to Pearson’s X² for scientific discovery" (Baharav et al., 2024)

##### Overview and Motivation {-}
The article introduces **OASIS (Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure)**, a novel statistical framework for testing contingency tables. Contingency tables (matrices of count data) are common in quantitative research, especially genomics. OASIS addresses significant limitations of Pearson’s chi-squared (X²) test, notably invalid finite-sample P-values, lack of robustness, and interpretability, making it suited for sparse, high-dimensional data common in modern genomic studies.

***

##### Methodological Approach {-}

###### 1. **Construction of OASIS Test Statistic** {-}
- Constructs residuals linear in the normalized contingency table data, effectively capturing structured deviations from independence.
- Computes a centered and normalized matrix \( \tilde{X} \), derived by subtracting expected values from observed counts and normalizing by column totals.

###### 2. **Finite-Sample Valid P-value Computation** {-}
- Uses classical concentration inequalities (Hoeffding’s inequality) instead of asymptotic approximations, thus providing rigorous, finite-sample valid P-value bounds.
- The OASIS statistic is defined as a linear form:
\[
S = f^\top \tilde{X} c
\]
where \( f \) and \( c \) are embedding vectors for rows and columns, respectively, selected via optimization, randomization, or metadata.
- Finite-sample valid P-value bound:
\[
P(|S| \ge s) \le 2\exp\left(-\frac{2s^2}{1 - \gamma}\right)
\]
where \( \gamma \) quantifies correlation between column embeddings and sample sizes.

###### 3. **Asymptotic Normality and P-value Approximation** {-}
- Provides theoretical proofs showing OASIS's statistic converges to a normal distribution asymptotically, allowing standard Gaussian approximation of P-values for large samples.
- Asymptotic approximation closely aligns with finite-sample bounds, incorporating a variance parameter \( \sigma_f^2 \) derived from the embedding vector \( f \).

***

##### Statistical Variability and Randomness {-}

###### 1. **Randomness in Data-Splitting and Embeddings** {-}
- Implements data-splitting (training/test sets) to select optimal embedding vectors without statistical bias, ensuring validity via Bonferroni corrections for multiple splits.
- Contingency table counts are modeled explicitly as multinomial distributions under the null hypothesis, integrating randomness directly into theoretical guarantees.

###### 2. **Robustness to Variability (Overdispersion)** {-}
- OASIS explicitly addresses **overdispersion**, common in genomic data such as single-cell RNA sequencing, ensuring robustness.
- Simulations confirm OASIS maintains robust control of the false discovery rate (FDR), whereas Pearson’s X² often fails under similar conditions.

***

##### Power and Performance {-}
- Simulations demonstrate that OASIS significantly outperforms Pearson’s X² in detecting structured deviations from the null hypothesis (e.g., distinct two-group scenarios).
- Conversely, OASIS shows lower power relative to Pearson’s X² in scenarios with diffuse, noisy signals, highlighting a clear trade-off emphasizing structured signal detection.

***

##### Applications and Interpretability {-}
- OASIS successfully applied to genomic data, such as de novo detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis variants, outperforming existing methods without relying on reference genomes.
- Provides interpretability post-inference, clearly indicating why the null hypothesis was rejected via meaningful embedding vectors, in contrast to purely exploratory techniques like correspondence analysis.

***

##### Statistical Validity and Effect Size {-}
- Defines a clear, intuitive effect size measure quantifying differences between groups identified by embeddings. This effect size is bounded by total variation distance, ensuring practical interpretability.
- Provides rigorous proofs for the finite-sample validity of its P-values using classical probability and concentration inequality arguments.

***

##### Conclusions and Broader Implications {-}
- Highlights OASIS’s potential beyond contingency tables, offering a general framework potentially applicable to structured inference, matrix decomposition, and multi-table inference beyond standard singular value decomposition (SVD).

***

##### Supplemental Information Highlights {-}
- Extensive mathematical proofs are provided, supporting theoretical claims regarding finite-sample validity, asymptotic normality, and embedding optimization.
- Additional simulations emphasize robustness, stability, and effectiveness of embedding optimization strategies under various statistical conditions.

***

**In summary**, OASIS provides a statistically rigorous, computationally efficient, robust, and interpretable alternative to Pearson’s X² test, particularly valuable in modern genomics and other domains dealing with high-dimensional, sparse, structured data.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121(15), e2304671121. [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2304671121](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2304671121)*

##### 🔍 Overview  {-}

OASIS (Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure) is a family of statistical tests designed for **contingency table analysis**, providing:

- Finite-sample valid p-values
- Closed-form bounds
- Interpretability through a linear test-statistic
- Better robustness to noise and overdispersion than Pearson’s χ² test

It is particularly suited for **sparse and high-dimensional data**, such as those arising in genomics.

***

##### 🧮 Test Statistic  {-}

Given a count matrix \( X \in \mathbb{N}^{I \times J} \), the OASIS test statistic is:

\[
S = f^\top \tilde{X} c
\]

Where:
- \( f \in \mathbb{R}^I \): row embedding vector
- \( c \in \mathbb{R}^J \): column embedding vector
- \( \tilde{X} \): the centered and column-normalized matrix

This structure allows for **signal aggregation** and **dampening of noise** through linear algebraic properties.

***

##### 📊 Statistical Randomness and Finite-Sample Validity  {-}

###### Reformulation via Latent Variables  {-}

Each table cell count \( X_{i,j} \) is constructed from i.i.d. latent variables:

\[
Z_{j,k} \sim p, \quad X_{i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} \mathbb{1}\{Z_{j,k} = i\}
\]

This allows \( S \) to be written as a **weighted sum of independent random variables**, enabling concentration bounds.

***

###### Finite-Sample p-Value Bound  {-}

Using **Hoeffding’s inequality**, the authors derive:

\[
P(|S| \geq s) \leq 2 \exp\left( \frac{-2s^2}{1 - \gamma} \right)
\]

Where:

\[
\gamma = \left( \frac{\sum_j c_j \sqrt{n_j}}{\sqrt{M} \|c\|} \right)^2, \quad M = \sum_j n_j
\]

- This is valid for any fixed \( f, c \)
- Ensures **exact control** of type I error for **any sample size**

***

##### 📈 Asymptotic Normality  {-}

The statistic converges to a normal distribution as sample sizes increase:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \gamma}} S \xrightarrow{D} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_f^2 \|c\|^2)
\]

Where:

\[
\sigma_f^2 = \text{Var}_{Z \sim p}(f_Z)
\]

- Derived via **Lyapunov’s Central Limit Theorem**
- Ensures smooth transition between finite-sample and asymptotic inference

***

##### 🧪 Effect Size  {-}

OASIS defines an **effect size estimate**:

\[
\hat{\Delta} = \left| \mathbb{E}_{p_A}[f_Z] - \mathbb{E}_{p_B}[f_Z] \right|
\]

- Measures difference between two groups
- Upper bounded by **total variation distance** \( \delta_{TV}(p_A, p_B) \)
- Ensures effect size is biologically meaningful

***

##### 🔁 Data-Splitting Validity  {-}

To avoid overfitting:
- Data is split into train/test sets
- Embeddings \( f \), \( c \) are learned on train, evaluated on test
- The p-value remains valid under classical **data-splitting logic**:

\[
P(p(X) \leq u) \leq u
\]

Multiple random splits are allowed, with **Bonferroni correction** to maintain error control.

***

##### 📚 Comparison with Pearson’s χ²  {-}

| Feature | Pearson χ² | OASIS |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| P-values | Asymptotic | Finite-sample valid |
| Residual Aggregation | Squared sum | Bilinear form |
| Normalization | Rows & columns | Columns only |
| Interpretability | Post-hoc via SVD | Built-in |
| Robustness | Poor (esp. overdispersion) | Strong |

***

#### ✅ Conclusion  {-}

OASIS offers:
- Closed-form finite-sample p-value bounds
- Asymptotic normality
- Interpretability through test structure
- High performance in noisy, sparse biological data

It is a rigorous, modern replacement for χ² tests in scientific discovery contexts, especially genomics.

## Tests for Contingency Tables

Before looking at the SPLASH data and OASIS algorithm, we take a quick look at classical
statistical tests for contingency tables.

---

### 1. Classical Statistical Tests {-}

#### 1.1 Pearson’s \( \chi^2 \) Test {-}

Pearson’s chi-square test compares observed counts \( O_{ij} \) with expected counts \( E_{ij} \) under the null hypothesis of independence. The test statistic is:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
\]

- **Advantages:** Simple, widely used, computationally efficient.
- **Limitations:** Relies on asymptotic approximation; invalid when expected counts are low (e.g., \( E_{ij} < 5 \)); no interpretability beyond significance.

<br/>

#### 1.2 Log-Linear Models  {-}

Log-linear models describe the logarithm of expected counts as a linear function of categorical predictors. The likelihood ratio test statistic is:

\[
G^2 = 2 \sum_{i,j} O_{ij} \left[ \log(O_{ij}) - \log(E_{ij}) \right]
\]

- **Advantages:** Flexibility for modeling multi-way interactions; connections to information geometry.
- **Limitations:** Requires iterative maximum likelihood estimation; asymptotic inference only; unstable when counts are very low or zero.

---

### 2. Simulation-Based and Limited-Information Methods {-}

Monte Carlo and permutation-based tests provide finite-sample inference without relying on asymptotics. However:

- **Computation is intensive**, especially in large tables or multiple testing contexts.
- **Interpretability is limited**, often offering only significance without structural insight.

Limited-information approaches analyze margins or low-dimensional projections but do not scale well or generalize to arbitrary contingency structures.

---

### 3. OASIS: Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure {-}

OASIS, proposed by [@Baharav:2024aa], is a statistical test for contingency tables developed in conjunction with SPLASH [@Chaung:2023aa]. It is specifically designed for sparse and structured settings such as reference-free genomic inference.

The test statistic is a bilinear form:

\[
S = f^\top \tilde{X} c
\]

Where:
- \( \tilde{X} = (O - E) \cdot \text{diag}(1/\sqrt{\text{colSums}(O)}) \)
- \( f \in \mathbb{R}^I \) and \( c \in \mathbb{R}^J \) are row and column embeddings, either fixed or optimized.

**Key characteristics:** 

* Finite-sample valid p-value bounds using Hoeffding-type inequalities.  
* Efficient, closed-form evaluation—no resampling or iterative fitting.  
* Embedding-based decomposition enables some interpretability.  
* Suitable for structured alternatives such as strain-level genomic differences.  

---

### 4. Comparison Table {-}

The following table compares OASIS to two classical alternatives for testing independence in contingency tables.

| Feature                        | **OASIS**                                           | **Pearson’s \( \chi^2 \)**                      | **Log-Linear Models**                             |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Statistic**            | \( S = f^\top \tilde{X} c \), where \( \tilde{X} = (O - E) \cdot \text{diag}(1/\sqrt{\text{colSums}(O)}) \) | \( \chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} \) | \( G^2 = 2 \sum_{i,j} O_{ij} \left[ \log(O_{ij}) - \log(E_{ij}) \right] \) |
| **Inference Type**           | Finite-sample valid bounds                         | Asymptotic                                    | Asymptotic                                        |
| **P-value Computation**      | Closed-form concentration inequality               | χ² distribution (approximate)                 | Likelihood ratio test statistic (approximate)     |
| **Susceptibility to Outliers** | Moderate (linear in residuals)                     | Severe (squared residuals)                    | Very low (log-scaling dampens extremes)           |
| **Low-Count Performance**    | Valid but potentially unstable                     | Invalid when expected counts < 5              | Invalid (MLE may not exist or be degenerate)      |
| **Interpretability**         | Embedding-based; directional                        | None inherent                                 | With some extra work                              |
| **Computational Cost**       | Low (non-iterative)                                | Low                                           | High (requires iterative estimation)              |
---

<!-- 
| **Compositional Geometry**   | No (based on residual differences)                 | No                                            | Yes (log-ratio structure, KL divergence)          |
-->

<!-- 
### 5. Application Context: SPLASH and OASIS {-}

OASIS was developed to complement the SPLASH algorithm [@Chaung:2023aa], which reframes genomic discovery as detection of sample-dependent structure in k-mer count tables. SPLASH generates a large number of contingency tables, and OASIS provides the statistical validation step with p-value control even in sparse data. Together, they form a framework for reference-free, statistically valid genomic inference.

---

### 6. Discussion: Stability, Robustness, and Geometry {-}

#### 6.1 Stability at Low Counts {-}

Although OASIS provides **valid p-value bounds**, this does not ensure **stability** of the results under small perturbations to sparse tables:

- In low-count settings, small changes to a single cell can **dramatically change** normalized residuals \( \tilde{X}_{ij} \), potentially reversing test outcomes.
- Log-linear models may be **invalid** in such settings (e.g., MLE failure), but when estimable, they are often **more stable** under small perturbations due to their use of smoothed log-ratio-based contrasts.

#### 6.2 Sensitivity to Overdispersion {-}

OASIS uses **linear residuals** and is thus **moderately sensitive to outliers**, especially if aligned with the direction of the embedding vectors.

- Pearson's \( \chi^2 \) is **severely affected** by outliers due to squaring of residuals.
- Log-linear models are **less affected** by extreme counts due to the slow growth of the log function and their intrinsic relation to KL divergence.

#### 6.3 Geometric Interpretability {-}

OASIS has been described as “geometric” in the sense of its **bilinear projection** form:
\[
S = f^\top \tilde{X} c
\]
This form enables interpretability via decomposition into row and column contrasts.

However, it lacks the **information-geometric** properties of log-ratio models:
- Log-linear models operate in the space of **relative changes**, aligning with **compositional data analysis** and **multiplicative invariance**.
- They are more naturally suited to biological count data where interpretation often depends on **proportions** rather than absolute differences.

## OASIS vs log-linear {.tabset}

### Home {-}

<br/>
<br/>

### Option A {-}

#### 6. Discussion: Stability, Robustness, and Geometry of OASIS vs. Log-Linear Models {-}

##### 6.1 Stability at Low Counts {-}

While OASIS provides **finite-sample valid p-value bounds** using classical concentration inequalities, this does **not guarantee statistical stability**. In sparse contingency tables where row and column totals are small:

- A single count difference in a low-count cell can produce a **large change in the normalized residual** \( \tilde{X}_{ij} \), potentially **flipping the direction or magnitude** of the OASIS test statistic.
- This is especially problematic when the row and column embeddings \( f \) and \( c \) concentrate weight on those cells.
- In contrast, log-linear models may **fail** (e.g., with undefined likelihood when \( O_{ij} = 0 \)), but when valid, their **log-ratio based inference is smoother** and less sensitive to small changes.

Thus, OASIS is **valid but not necessarily stable** under low-count perturbations.

##### 6.2 Overdispersion and Sensitivity to Outliers {-}

OASIS's reliance on raw count differences means that **overdispersed counts** — i.e., rare but large deviations — can **heavily influence the test statistic**. In real biological data, this may amplify the signal from noise or contamination:

- If an overdispersed entry aligns with the structure in \( f \) and \( c \), it can **dominate** the signal.
- The log-linear likelihood ratio statistic, in contrast, uses:
  \[
  G^2 = 2 \sum_{i,j} O_{ij} \left[ \log(O_{ij}) - \log(E_{ij}) \right]
  \]
  which **grows slowly** with outliers and is more robust to extreme counts.

Therefore, while OASIS is robust in theory (due to finite-sample control), it may be **more sensitive to outliers in practice** than the log-likelihood ratio.


<br/>
<br/>

### Option B {-} 

* Appendix: Nuanced Comparisons Between OASIS and Log-Linear Models

#### A.1 Stability in Low-Count Regimes {-}

Although OASIS provides closed-form p-value bounds valid for any number of observations, its **statistic may not be stable** in sparse settings. This is because:

- A single change in a low-count entry can substantially alter the normalized residual matrix \( \tilde{X} \).
- The test statistic \( S = f^\top \tilde{X} c \) aggregates these residuals linearly, so instability in one cell can reverse the outcome.

By contrast, log-linear models — when estimable — often **smooth out such variation** due to the concavity of the log function.

<br/>

#### A.2 Sensitivity to Overdispersion {-}

OASIS's linear formulation makes it **more sensitive to extreme residuals** than log-linear approaches:

- Overdispersed counts (common in single-cell or microbial data) can disproportionately affect OASIS.
- The log-likelihood ratio statistic:
  \[
  G^2 = 2 \sum O_{ij} (\log(O_{ij}) - \log(E_{ij}))
  \]
  increases **logarithmically**, providing **a form of outlier damping**.

Hence, while OASIS is theoretically robust to some forms of noise, it may be **practically vulnerable to heavy-tailed count distributions**.

### A.3 What Makes a Method "Geometric"? {-}

OASIS’s bilinear test statistic can be interpreted as a **projection** of the normalized contingency table, akin to PCA or correspondence analysis.

However, it does **not** respect the **multiplicative, compositional structure** of biological count data.

In contrast:
- Log-linear models operate on **log-ratios**, aligning with **Aitchison geometry** and **KL divergence**.
- This makes them inherently geometric in the **information-theoretic and compositional data** sense.

Thus, log-linear tests offer **more biologically natural geometry**, especially when comparing proportions across groups.

## Multinomial Distance Metrics 

<br/>

### D Metric {-} 

<font color="darkgreen">
* This `D` is different than the D in SPLASH
   - should behave similarly when total counts are similar
   - with no scaling and doing the math on the linear scale is interesting
</font>

<br/>

You've provided two multinomial distributions \(P\) and \(Q\), defined as:

\[
P = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\}, \quad Q = \{q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n\}
\]

and defined a distance metric \(D\) as:

\[
D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(p_i, q_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i + q_i)}
\]

---

### Step-by-step analysis of the defined metric \( D \): {-}

**Step 1: Interpretation**

- The numerator \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(p_i, q_i)\) measures the **overlap** between the two distributions.
- The denominator \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i + q_i)\) is simply the sum of all probabilities from both distributions, and if both distributions sum to 1 (i.e., are probability distributions), this denominator equals exactly \(1 + 1 = 2\).

Thus, assuming valid probability distributions (\(\sum p_i = 1\), \(\sum q_i = 1\)), the formula simplifies to:

\[
D = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(p_i, q_i)}{2}
\]

---

### Step 2: Properties of \( D \) {-}

- **Range**:  
  Since \(0 \leq \sum_{i}\min(p_i, q_i) \leq 1\), it follows that:
  - Minimum possible value: If \(P = Q\), then \(\sum\min(p_i,q_i)=1\), and thus:
  \[
  D = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
  \]
  *(This indicates your provided formula might have a slight issue if your intention is that distance should be 0 when \(P=Q\). Typically, distance measures satisfy \(D(P,Q)=0\) if and only if \(P=Q\). The current formulation does not satisfy this.)*

- **When are P and Q completely disjoint?**  
  If \(P\) and \(Q\) do not overlap at all (no common support), then \(\sum\min(p_i,q_i)=0\), thus:
  \[
  D = 1 - \frac{0}{2} = 1
  \]

Thus, according to your current formula:

- Completely identical distributions \(P=Q\) yield \(D=0.5\).
- Completely distinct distributions yield \(D=1\).

If you intended to measure similarity or overlap, the standard formulation should typically be either:

\[
D_{standard} = 1 - \sum_{i}\min(p_i,q_i)
\]

or

\[
D_{normalized} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i}\min(p_i,q_i)}{\sum_{i}\max(p_i,q_i)}
\]

These alternative definitions yield the intuitive property: \(D(P,Q)=0\) if \(P=Q\).

---

### Step 3: Suggested corrected metric {-}

If your goal is to define a metric distance measure between distributions, a commonly used overlap-based measure is:

\[
D'(P,Q) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(p_i,q_i)
\]

Properties of this standard metric:

- Range: \([0,1]\)
- \(D'(P,Q)=0\) if and only if \(P=Q\)
- \(D'(P,Q)=1\) if distributions are completely disjoint.

---

### **Summary:** {-}

| Metric | Definition | Range | \(P=Q\) | Disjoint \(P,Q\) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your Provided Metric \(D\) | \(1 - \frac{\sum\min(p_i,q_i)}{\sum(p_i+q_i)}\) | [0.5,1] | 0.5 (unusual) | 1 |
| Standard Overlap Distance \(D'\) | \(1-\sum\min(p_i,q_i)\) | [0,1] | 0 (intuitive) | 1 |

---

### **Conclusion and Recommendation:** {-}

- Your given metric is mathematically valid but has an unusual property of having a nonzero lower bound (0.5) even when distributions are identical.
- If the intention is to measure a meaningful distance between two probability distributions (multinomial), **consider using the standard overlap metric \(D'\)** above, which provides intuitive and desirable properties for practical applications:

\[
\boxed{D'(P,Q) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(p_i,q_i)}
\]

If you have a specific reason for choosing your original formula, please clarify so I can adjust accordingly.

### Concensus 

* Query:
   - what are RNA-Seq methods to compare across samples the within sample relative expression
gene profiles 

* **Response**

#### RNA-Seq Methods to Compare Within-Sample Relative Gene Expression Profiles Across Samples {-}

To compare within-sample relative gene expression profiles **across samples** using RNA-Seq, several robust methods have been developed. These focus on preserving the **internal gene ranking or patterns within each sample**, enabling reliable cross-sample comparison.

#### Evidence: {-}

1. **Relative Expression Orderings (REOs):**  
   REO-based methods compare the order of gene expression levels **within each sample**. These within-sample gene pair rankings are highly stable and reproducible across samples, even in low-input or noisy datasets. REOs can be used to construct transcriptional signatures for disease classification that are consistent across sample types and platforms [(Liu et al., 2017)](https://consensus.app/papers/robust-transcriptional-signatures-for-lowinput-rna-liu-li/9070d1f21109546eb95d81580374d552/?utm_source=chatgpt).

2. **Count-Based Methods for Relative Quantification:**  
   Standard RNA-Seq tools like DESeq2 and edgeR focus on relative quantification across samples by modeling count data, which preserves within-sample gene profiles. These tools perform well in comparative analyses when absolute expression is unreliable [(Germain et al., 2016)](https://consensus.app/papers/rnaonthebench-computational-and-empirical-resources-for-germain-vitriolo/b19844c65eda53b8a95314d76e450473/?utm_source=chatgpt).

3. **Entropy-Based Method (RNentropy):**  
   RNentropy identifies genes with **significant variation of expression profiles across multiple samples**, without relying on pairwise comparisons. It highlights genes whose **within-sample expression patterns** vary consistently across conditions [(Zambelli et al., 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/rnentropy-an-entropybased-tool-for-the-detection-of-zambelli-mastropasqua/5609da623dd053a3a31023f16105d900/?utm_source=chatgpt).

4. **ClusterMap for Cross-Sample Subtype Matching:**  
   In single-cell RNA-Seq, ClusterMap matches cell subtypes across samples using **within-cluster marker gene expression** profiles. This highlights how internal gene expression patterns can be aligned across biological conditions [(Gao et al., 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/clustermap-comparing-analyses-across-multiple-single-gao-hu/54540d5160d35117a2a1a65b7e042e8a/?utm_source=chatgpt).

5. **TweeDEseq for Complex Expression Distributions:**  
   TweeDEseq models complex gene expression profiles across multiple samples using flexible count distributions. It improves fit to **within-sample expression variability**, especially in large or highly replicated datasets [(Esnaola et al., 2013)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-flexible-count-data-model-to-fit-the-wide-diversity-of-esnaola-puig/2369baa5e30057e5975330317af067cb/?utm_source=chatgpt).

#### **Conclusion**: {-}

To compare relative gene expression profiles across samples, RNA-Seq methods such as REO-based approaches, count-based models like DESeq2, entropy-based tools (RNentropy), and cross-sample clustering methods like ClusterMap provide robust, biologically meaningful results by leveraging **within-sample expression structure**.

* In high throughput analysis, including most-omics, unwanted shared variability
among features is to be expected.  An analysis is incomplete if it does not
include a careful examination of the data to detect any sign of unwanted variability.
See the RUV literature  [@Molania:2023aa; @Gerard:2021aa; @Jiang:2023aa].
   - ideally we would measure the level of unwanted variability

<p><p/>
* The statistical standard errors of measurement, or the sampling errors, are only
one source of variability in data collected in a high throughput,
massively parallel fashion.  Other sources of variability such as
reagent lots, instruments, operators, days (ie. day to day variability is variability
that is not otherwise specified) will often dominate the total variability.
   - The Bin Yu Group [@Yu:2024aa;@Yu:2020aa;@Yu:2013aa;@Yu:2018aa] suggest the use of
**stability** as a more comprehensive or inclusive measure of variability to monitor

and optimize by study design and/or parameter setting.

<p><p/>
* Theoretical properties of summaries can provide guidance for the design of
analysis steps or components, but they get their value from the properties
they confer to the procedures.
   - ie. the q-value filter is correct if the resulting procedure 
achieves a good balance between sensitivity and specificity
 
<p><p/>
* For the purpose of discovery or feature identification,
it is the distribution of the summaries over the study dataset that matters most.
   - Is the distribution of values of a statistic used to filter or select
features peaked, flat, heavy-tailed?
   - Is the shape consistent with expectations?  If the shape is not as expected,
the points falling in the tails may also not have the expected interpretation.

<p><p/>
* In high throughput data analysis, data summaries play a prominent role 
such that almost every analysis is statistical in some sense so that attaching

-->

<p><p/>
* Outside of simulated data, p-values cannot be taken at face value
**without careful scrutiny of the data in every case**.  q-values even less so.
   - In omic scale analyses it has not been possible to carefully examine

AI may change this.
   - The shape of the distribution of scores across the omic scale 
can be examined to ensure that it meets expectations.
   - When p-values are off on some way, the impact this has on the results
should be ascertained empirically on the -omic scale with appropriate data.

##### 6.3 Geometric Interpretability {-}

The term "geometric" has been used to describe OASIS due to its **bilinear structure**:
\[
S = f^\top \tilde{X} c
\]
This allows projection and decomposition, reminiscent of PCA or correspondence analysis. However, this is **algebraic**, not **compositional geometry**.

In contrast, the **log-ratio** statistic used in log-linear models is:
- Geometrically rooted in **information geometry**.
- Directly connected to **Kullback–Leibler divergence** and **compositional data analysis**.
- Reflective of **multiplicative scale-invariant relationships** common in biology.

Thus, log-linear models are **more inherently geometric** in the biological and statistical sense than OASIS.


## The Chi-squared test in RNA-Seq

In typical RNA-seq analysis, the Chi-square test is rarely used directly for feature identification because RNA-seq count data are usually modeled with negative binomial or Poisson distributions due to the inherent variability (overdispersion) in counts.

However, there are scenarios and some less-common or exploratory approaches that employ Chi-square or similar methods. Generally, Chi-square tests might appear in RNA-seq workflows for categorical or proportion comparisons rather than the standard count-based feature identification.

### Known R packages using Chi-square tests in RNA-seq context:

- **NOISeq**:
  - Primarily uses non-parametric approaches, but it includes methods that use Fisher’s exact or Chi-square-based tests for differential expression identification as part of exploratory analyses.

- **edgeR** and **DESeq2**:
  - These two prominent packages primarily use negative binomial models and likelihood ratio or Wald tests. However, users occasionally perform Chi-square-based post hoc or exploratory tests manually to analyze categorical proportions (e.g., enrichment analysis).

- **baySeq**:
  - Primarily Bayesian, but some exploratory downstream analyses may apply Chi-square tests (outside primary differential expression methods) for categorical or GO enrichment comparisons.

### Typical Usage Scenario:
- Chi-square tests might be used explicitly in RNA-seq analyses to test enrichment (e.g., gene ontology enrichment, KEGG pathway enrichment) rather than feature selection itself.

### Common Alternatives (Preferred Approaches):
- **DESeq2** (Negative Binomial, Wald test)
- **edgeR** (Negative Binomial, Likelihood Ratio test)
- **limma-voom** (Linear modeling with empirical Bayes)

### Recommendation:
- For direct **feature identification** (gene selection), Chi-square tests are uncommon and generally not recommended due to assumptions violations (independence and expected frequency conditions).
- For categorical or proportion-based testing, Chi-square tests are occasionally applicable post-DE analysis (enrichment analysis).

If you explicitly want to explore categorical relationships or perform enrichment analysis with Chi-square-based methods in RNA-seq context, you can use:

- **GOstats**
- **topGO**
- **clusterProfiler** (which primarily uses hypergeometric tests or Fisher’s exact test, but Chi-square can sometimes be implemented manually).

In summary, no mainstream RNA-seq differential expression package explicitly uses Chi-square for primary gene selection due to its statistical limitations with RNA-seq count data, but Chi-square tests occasionally find use in downstream enrichment or categorical analyses.

## What is Biological Inference?

* Submitted to SciSpace (copilot)

**Poor definition.**

**Biological inference** refers to the process of drawing conclusions about biological systems, processes, or phenomena using data analysis, statistical models, and computational methods. It involves using observed biological data to make predictions, identify patterns, or infer underlying mechanisms.

<br/>

### Key Aspects of Biological Inference:
1. **Data-Driven Analysis**: Utilizes experimental or observational biological data.
2. **Statistical and Computational Models**: Applies statistical inference, machine learning, and bioinformatics tools.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluates scientific hypotheses based on data.
4. **Predictive Insights**: Helps predict biological behaviors and interactions.

<br/>

### Examples of Biological Inference:
- **Genomic Inference**: Identifying genetic variations linked to diseases.
- **Phylogenetic Inference**: Reconstructing evolutionary relationships among species.
- **Protein Structure Prediction**: Inferring 3D structures from amino acid sequences.
- **Ecological Inference**: Understanding species distribution and population dynamics.
- **Systems Biology**: Modeling complex biological networks and interactions.

<br/>

### Applications:
- **Medicine**: Predicting disease susceptibility and drug responses.
- **Evolutionary Biology**: Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation.
- **Ecology**: Assessing environmental impacts on biodiversity.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing large-scale biological datasets.

biological inference plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of life sciences 
by integrating data-driven approaches to uncover hidden patterns and 
relationships in biological systems.

* Read the attached paper by Sood et.al. 2015 [@Sood:2015aa].

* Act as a statistician who is proficient in the traditional statistical concepts as they apply to the analysis of designed experiments, as well as in the novel statistical concepts developed for the analysis of omic data, and review the article.

* The review should not consider findings from later studies

* The review should focus on the statistical aspects of the data collected and analysed.
* Key statistical principles include:
  - verifying that the training data points can be thought of as being
a representative, random subset of the target population
  - a representative subset most include enough of the right sort of sample.
   - how many data collection runs are aggregated or pooled to assemble the analysis dataset?
   - how are the different tissue types distributed across data generation runs?  
   - Is run associated with age. 
   - Were the data from different runs normalized?
* What evidence is provided that the classifiers developed work well with datasets analyzed and will continue to work well when future data are analyzed?

* Keep the report in un-rendered markdown format, or markdown syntax.
* Also include the markdown syntax for a bibliography of citations.

Note that what the authors  call external validation  entails fitting a new model with each dataset.  There is no validation of a model; only validation that the subset of 150 probe sets are sufficient to enable KNN + LOOCV to give rise to a fitted model that still discriminates.  This is not validation in the usual sense.  There is no attempt to compare the fitted models from the different data sets.  Jacob and Speed (attached) show that repeating the fit and eval procedures with a random selection of 150 probe sets achieves similar discrimination on some datasets.
Please include these facts in the conclusions to be drawn form these data.
