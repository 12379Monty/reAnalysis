## Response  {-}

* Literature Review: Inferring Age from Omic Profiles

### Introduction

The association between omic profiles and subject age has become a crucial area of research in aging biology. Omic-based models leverage molecular features such as DNA methylation, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to infer chronological and biological age. This review synthesizes recent findings on the predictive capability of omic profiles for age inference, highlighting the number of features used, model architectures, and the gain in predictive accuracy due to omic feature inclusion.

### Omic-Based Age Prediction Models

#### 1. Multi-Omics Age Prediction Approaches

Chen et al. (2023) developed OMICmAge, an integrative multi-omics approach that predicts biological age by combining DNA methylation (DNAm) with proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data [(Chen et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-chen-dwaraka/3281ad73801b5cb3bfdf3c6b190dd010/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their elastic-net regression model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting mortality risk compared to existing biomarkers.

Dwaraka et al. (2024) further refined OMICmAge, reporting an average ROC of 0.88 for predicting 5- and 10-year mortality [(Dwaraka et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-dwaraka-chen/4b2a974fdb4a57d09c85a121b156317d/?utm_source=chatgpt).

#### 2. Metabolomic Clocks

Hwangbo et al. (2021) developed a metabolomic aging clock using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolite and lipid data [(Hwangbo et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-metabolomic-aging-clock-using-human-csf-hwangbo-zhang/1431a6651f09501fbf5a2a986a81ca91/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their predictive models estimated chronological age within 10 years. Key metabolites associated with aging included the carnitine shuttle, sucrose, biopterin, and vitamin E metabolism.

Robinson et al. (2018) integrated metabolomics and DNA methylation data to assess metabolic age acceleration in a UK cohort [(Robinson et al., 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/metabolomic-aging-and-its-association-with-depression-in-a-robinson-hyam/38b2b6b774fb53c384e568ecdc35b41b/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their elastic-net model used 472 features and achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.85 with chronological age.

#### 3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Van Hilten et al. (2023) implemented biologically interpretable neural networks for multi-omics age prediction using RNA expression and CpG methylation data [(Van Hilten et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/phenotype-prediction-using-biologically-interpretable-hilten-rooij/752664ee876f5317a1be6aec64e9ce66/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their model inferred age with a mean error of 5.16 years and identified consistently predictive genes such as COL11A2, AFAP1, and CD34.

#### 4. Machine Learning for Omic Feature Selection

Uche et al. (2021) investigated the role of omics in improving machine learning interpretability [(Uche et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/can-omics-help-in-prognostic-machine-learning-uche-caruana/5b496ae621ca5fdeba66c5cfafff7c1c/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) demonstrated that incorporating omic features enhanced the model’s predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Zenbout et al. (2023) proposed an optimized bioinspired feature selection approach for omic data analysis, which significantly improved predictive performance in clinical endpoint predictions [(Zenbout et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/efficient-bioinspired-feature-selection-and-machine-zenbout-bouramoul/98159e634b9958aea029c8a8f7699ef4/?utm_source=chatgpt).

### Gain in Predictive Accuracy Due to Omic Features

- **OMICmAge**: Outperformed traditional biomarkers with an ROC of 0.88 [(Dwaraka et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-dwaraka-chen/4b2a974fdb4a57d09c85a121b156317d/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Metabolomic Aging Clocks**: Achieved age predictions within a 10-year margin [(Hwangbo et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-metabolomic-aging-clock-using-human-csf-hwangbo-zhang/1431a6651f09501fb5a2a986a81ca91/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Deep Learning Models**: Reduced mean absolute error to 5.16 years [(Van Hilten et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/phenotype-prediction-using-biologically-interpretable-hilten-rooij/752664ee876f5317a1be6aec64e9ce66/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Machine Learning Interpretability**: Increased model accuracy by incorporating omic features [(Uche et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/can-omics-help-in-prognostic-machine-learning-uche-caruana/5b496ae621ca5fdeba66c5cfafff7c1c/?utm_source=chatgpt).

### Conclusion

Recent advancements in age prediction using omic profiles demonstrate the potential of multi-omics integration and machine learning models in improving chronological and biological age inference. The use of deep learning and optimized feature selection methods has significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights into aging biology and age-related diseases.
